his book is what its author believes to be the only attempt yet made to
put the nglish reader into possession, in clear, compact, and what it
is hoped may prove agreeable, form, of the mythical, legendary, and
poetic traditions of the earliest inhabitants of our islands who have
left us written recordsâ€”the Gaelic and the ritish Celts. It is true
that admirable translations and paraphrases of much of Gaelic mythical
saga have been recently published, and that ady Charlotte Guestâ€s
translation of the Mabinogion has been placed within the reach of the
least wealthy reader. ut these books not merely each cover a portion
only of the whole ground, but, in addition, contain little elucidatory
matter. heir characters stand isolated and unexplained and the details
that would explain them must be sought for with considerable trouble in
the lectures and essays of scholars to learned societies. he reader to
whom this literature is entirely new is introduced, as it were, to
numerous people of whose antecedents he knows nothing and the effect is
often disconcerting enough to make him lay down the volume in despair.

ut here he will at last make the formal acuaintance of all the chief
characters of Celtic myth of the Gaelic gods and the giants against
whom they struggled of the â€Champions of the ed ranchâ€ of lster,
heroes of a martial epopee almost worthy to be placed beside â€the tale
of roy divineâ€ and of inn and his enians. e will meet also with the
divine and heroic personages of the ancient ritons with their earliest
gods, kin to the members of the Gaelic antheon as well as with Arthur
and his nights, whom he will recognize as no mortal champions, but
belonging to the same mythic company. f all these mighty figures the
histories will be briefly recorded, from the time of their unuestioned
godhood, through their various transformations, to the last doubtful,
dying recognition of them in the present day, as â€fairiesâ€. hus the
volume will form a kind of handbook to a subect of growing
importanceâ€”the socalled â€Celtic enaissanceâ€, which is, after all, no
moreâ€”and, indeed, no lessâ€”than an endeavour to refresh the vitality of
nglish poetry at its most ancient native fount.

he book does not, of course, profess to be for Celtic scholars, to
whom, indeed, its author himself owes all that is within it. It aims
only at interesting the reader familiar with the mythologies of Greece,
ome, and candinavia in another, and a nearer, source of poetry. Its
authorâ€s wish is to offer those who have fallen, or will fall, under the
attraction of Celtic legend and romance, ust such a volume as he
himself would once have welcomed, and for which he sought in vain. It is
his hope that, in choosing from the considerable, though scattered,
translations and commentaries of students of ld Gaelic and ld Welsh,
he has chosen wisely, and that his readers will be able, should they
wish, to use his book as a steppingstone to the authorities themselves.
o that end it is wholly directed and its marginal notes and short
bibliographical appendix follow the same plan. hey do not aspire to
anything like completeness, but only to point out the chief sources from
which he himself has drawn.

o acknowledge, as far as possible, such debts is now the authorâ€s
pleasing duty. irst and foremost, he has relied upon the volumes of M.
. dâ€Arbois de ubainvilleâ€s Cours de ittrature celtiue, and the
ibbert ectures for  of ohn hys, rofessor of Celtic in the
niversity of xford, with their seuel entitled tudies in the
Arthurian egend. rom the writings of Mr. Alfred utt he has also
obtained much help. With regard to direct translations, it seems almost
superfluous to refer to ady Charlotte Guestâ€s Mabinogion and Mr. W.
. keneâ€s our Ancient ooks of Wales, or to the work of such
wellknown Gaelic scholars as Mr. ugene â€Curry, r. uno Meyer, r.
Whitley tokes, r. rnest Windisch, Mr. tandish ayes â€Grady to
mention no others, as contained in such publications as the evue
Celtiue, the Atlantis, and the ransactions of the ssianic
ociety, in Mr. â€Gradyâ€s ilva Gadelica, Mr. uttâ€s oyage of
ran, on of ebal, and Miss ullâ€s Cuchullin aga. ut space is
lacking to do ustice to all. he reader is referred to the marginal
notes and the Appendix for the works of these and other authors, who
will no doubt pardon the use made of their researches to one whose sole
obect has been to gain a larger audience for the studies they have most
at heart.

inally, perhaps, a word should be said upon that vexed uestion, the
transliteration of Gaelic. As yet there is no universal or consistent
method of spelling. he author has therefore chosen the forms which
seemed most familiar to himself, hoping in that way to best serve the
uses of others.

It should hardly be necessary to remind the reader of what profound
interest and value to every nation are its earliest legendary and
poetical records. he beautiful myths of Greece form a sufficing
example. In threefold manner, they have influenced the destiny of the
people that created them, and of the country of which they were the
imagined theatre. irst, in the ages in which they were still fresh,
belief and pride in them were powerful enough to bring scattered tribes
into confederation. econdly, they gave the inspiration to sculptor and
poet of an art and literature unsurpassed, if not uneualled, by any
other age or race. astly, when â€the glory that was Greeceâ€ had faded,
and her people had, by dint of successive invasions, perhaps even ceased
to have any right to call themselves ellenes, they have passed over
into the literatures of the modern world, and so given to Greece herself
a poetic interest that still makes a petty kingdom of greater account in
the eyes of its compeers than many others far superior to it in extent
and resources.

his permeating influence of the Greek poetical mythology, apparent in
all civilized countries, has acted especially upon our own. rom almost
the very dawn of nglish literature, the Greek stories of gods and
heroes have formed a large part of the stockintrade of nglish poets.
he inhabitants of lympus occupy, under their betterknown atin names,
almost as great a space in nglish poetry as they did in that of the
countries to which they were native. rom Chaucer downwards, they have
captivated the imagination alike of the poets and their hearers. he
magic cauldron of classic myth fed, like the Celtic â€Grailâ€, all who
came to it for sustenance.

At last, however, its potency became somewhat exhausted. Alien and
exotic to nglish soil, it degenerated slowly into a convention. In the
shallow hands of the poetasters of the eighteenth century, its figures
became mere puppets. With every wood a â€groveâ€, and every rustic maid a
â€nymphâ€, one could only expect to find enus armed with patch and
powderpuff, Mars shouldering a musket, and Apollo inspiring the
versifierâ€s own trivial strains. he affectation killedâ€”and fortunately
killedâ€”a mode of expression which had become obsolete. mothered by ust
ridicule, and abandoned to the commonplace vocabulary of the inferior
hackwriter, classic myth became a subect which only the greatest poets
could afford to handle.

ut mythology is of such vital need to literature that, deprived of the
store of legend native to southern urope, imaginative writers looked
for a fresh impulse. hey turned their eyes to the orth. Inspiration
was sought, not from lympus, but from Asgard. Moreover, it was believed
that the fount of primeval poetry issuing from candinavian and eutonic
myth was truly our own, and that we were rightful heirs of it by reason
of the Angloaxon in our blood. And so, indeed, we are but it is not
our sole heritage. here must also run much Celticâ€”that is, truly
ritishâ€”blood in our veins. And Matthew Arnold was probably right in
asserting that, while we owe to the Angloaxon the more practical
ualities that have built up the ritish mpire, we have inherited from
the Celtic side that poetic vision which has made nglish literature the
most brilliant since the Greek.2

We have the right, therefore, to enter upon a new spiritual possession.
And a splendid one it is he Celtic mythology has little of the heavy
crudeness that repels one in eutonic and candinavian story. It is as
beautiful and graceful as the Greek and, unlike the Greek, which is the
reflection of a clime and soil which few of us will ever see, it is our
own. ivinities should, surely, seem the inevitable outgrowth of the
land they move in ow strange Apollo would appear, naked among
icebergs, or furclad hor striding under groves of palms ut the
Celtic gods and heroes are the natural inhabitants of a ritish
landscape, not seeming foreign and outofplace in a scene where there
is no vine or olive, but â€shading in withâ€ our homely oak and bracken,
gorse and heath.

hus we gain an altogether fresh interest in the beautiful spots of our
own islands, especially those of the wilder and more mountainous west,
where the older inhabitants of the land lingered longest. axon conuest
obliterated much in astern ritain, and changed more but in the West
of ngland, in Wales, in cotland, and especially in legendhaunted
Ireland, the hills and dales still keep memories of the ancient gods of
the ancient race. ere and there in outh Wales and the West of ngland
are regionsâ€”once mysterious and still romanticâ€”which the ritish Celts
held to be the homes of gods or outposts of the ther World. In Ireland,
not only is there scarcely a place that is not connected in some way
with the traditionary exploits of the â€ed ranch Championsâ€, or of inn
and his mighty men, but the old deities are still remembered, dwarfed
into fairies, but keeping the same attributes and the same names as of
yore. Wordsworthâ€s complaint that, while elion and ssa, lympus and
arnassus are â€in immortal books enrolledâ€, not one nglish mountain,
â€though round our seagirt shore they rise in crowdsâ€, had been â€by the
Celestial Muses glorifiedâ€ doubtless seemed true to his own generation.
hanks to the scholars who have unveiled the ancient Gaelic and ritish
mythologies, it need not be so for ours. n udgate ill, as well as on
many less famous eminences, once stood the temple of the ritish eus. A
mountain not far from ettwsyCoed was the ritish lympus, the court
and palace of our ancient gods.

It may well be doubted, however, whether Wordsworthâ€s contemporaries
would have welcomed the mythology which was their own by right of birth
as a substitute for that of Greece and ome. he inspiration of classic
culture, which Wordsworth was one of the first to break with, was still
powerful. ow some of its professors would have held their sides and
roared at the very notion of a ritish mythology Yet, all the time, it
had long been secretly leavening nglish ideas and ideals, none the less
potently because disguised under forms which could be readily
appreciated. opular fancy had rehabilitated the old gods, long banned
by the priestsâ€ bell, book, and candle, under various disguises. hey
still lived on in legend as kings of ancient ritain reigning in a
fabulous past anterior to ulius Caesarâ€”such were ing ud, founder of
ondon ing ear, whose legend was immortalized by hakespeare ing
rennius, who conuered ome as well as many others who will be found
filling parts in old drama. hey still lived on as longdead saints of
the early churches of Ireland and ritain, whose wonderful attributes
and adventures are, in many cases, only those of their original
namesakes, the old gods, told afresh. And they still lived on in
another, and a yet more potent, way. Myths of Arthur and his cycle of
gods passed into the hands of the orman storytellers, to reappear as
romances of ing Arthur and his nights of the able ound. hus spread
over civilized urope, their influence was immense. heir primal poetic
impulse is still resonant in our literature we need only instance
ennyson and winburne as minds that have come under its sway.

his diverse influence of Celtic mythology upon nglish poetry and
romance has been elouently set forth by Mr. lton in his rigins of
nglish istory. â€he religion of the ritish tribesâ€, he writes, â€has
exercised an important influence upon literature. he medival romances
and the legends which stood for history are full of the â€fair
humanitiesâ€ and figures of its bright mythology. he elemental powers of
earth and fire, and the spirits which haunted the waves and streams
appear again as kings in the Irish Annals, or as saints and hermits in
Wales. he nights of the ound able, ir ay and ristrem and the bold
ir edivere, betray their mighty origin by the attributes they retained
as heroes of romance. It was a goddess, â€ea uaedam phantasticaâ€, who
bore the wounded Arthur to the peaceful valley. â€here was little
sunlight on its woods and streams, and the nights were dark and gloomy
for want of the moon and stars.â€ his is the country of beron and of
ir uon of ordeaux. It is the dreamy forest of Arden. In an older
mythology, it was the realm of a ing of hadows, the country of Gwyn ap
udd, who rode as ir Guyon in the â€airie ueeneâ€â€”

           â€And knighthood took of good ir uonâ€s hand,
            When with ing beron he came to airylandâ€.â€

o trace Welsh and Irish kings and saints and hermits back to â€the
elemental powers of earth and fire, and the spirits that haunted the
woods and streamsâ€ of Celtic imagination, and to disclose primitive
pagan deities under the medival and Christian trappings of â€ing
Arthurâ€s nightsâ€ will necessarily fall within the scope of this volume.
ut meanwhile the reader will probably be asking what evidence there is
that apocryphal ritish kings like ear and ud, and uestionable Irish
saints like ridget are really disguised Celtic divinities, or that the
Morte â€Arthur, with its love of auncelot and the ueen, and its uest
of the oly Grail, was ever anything more than an invention of the
orman romancewriters. e will demand to know what facts we really
possess about this supposed Celtic mythology alleged to have furnished
their prototypes, and of what real antiuity and value are our
authorities upon it.

he answer to his uestion will be found in the next chapter.

We may begin by asserting with confidence that Mr. lton has touched
upon a part only of the material on which we may draw, to reconstruct
the ancient ritish mythology. uckily, we are not wholly dependent upon
the difficult tasks of resolving the fabled deeds of apocryphal Irish
and ritish kings who reigned earlier than t. atrick or before ulius
Caesar into their original form of Celtic myths, of sifting the
attributes and miracles of doubtfully historical saints, or of
separating the primitive pagan elements in the legends of Arthur and his
nights from the embellishments added by the romancewriters. We have,
in addition to theseâ€”which we may for the present put upon one side as
secondaryâ€”sources, a mass of genuine early writings which, though
postChristian in the form in which they now exist, none the less
descend from the preceding pagan age. hese are contained in vellum and
parchment manuscripts long preserved from destruction in mansions and
monasteries in Ireland, cotland, and Wales, and only during the last
century brought to light, copied, and translated by the patient labours
of scholars who have grappled with the longobsolete dialects in which
they were transcribed.

Many of these volumes are curious miscellanies. sually the one book of
a great house or monastic community, everything was copied into it that
the scholar of the family or brotherhood thought to be best worth
preserving. ence they contain matter of the most diverse kind. here
are translations of portions of the ible and of the classics, and of
such then popular books as Geoffrey of Monmouthâ€s and enniusâ€ istories
of ritain lives of famous saints, together with works attributed to
them poems and romances of which, under a thin disguise, the old Gaelic
and ritish gods are the heroes together with treatises on all the
subects then studiedâ€”grammar, prosody, law, history, geography,
chronology, and the genealogies of important chiefs.

he maority of these documents were put together during a period which,
roughly speaking, lasted from the beginning of the twelfth century to
the end of the sixteenth. In Ireland, in Wales, and, apparently, also in
cotland, it was a time of literary revival after the turmoils of the
previous epoch. In Ireland, the orsemen, after long ravaging, had
settled peacefully down, while in Wales, the orman Conuest had
rendered the country for the first time comparatively uiet. he
scattered remains of history, lay and ecclesiastical, of science, and of
legend were gathered together.

f the Irish manuscripts, the earliest, and, for our purposes, the most
important, on account of the great store of ancient Gaelic mythology
which, in spite of its dilapidated condition, it still contains, is in
the possession of the oyal Irish Academy. nluckily, it is reduced to a
fragment of one hundred and thirtyeight pages, but this remnant
preserves a large number of romances relating to the old gods and heroes
of Ireland. Among other things, it contains a complete account of the
epical saga called the in  Chuailgn, the â€aiding of the Cattle
of Cooleyâ€, in which the hero, Cuchulainn, performed his greatest feats.
his manuscript is called the ook of the un Cow, from the tradition
that it was copied from an earlier book written upon the skin of a
favourite animal belonging to aint Ciaran, who lived in the seventh
century. An entry upon one of its pages reveals the name of its scribe,
one Maelmuiri, whom we know to have been killed by robbers in the church
of Clonmacnois in the year 0.

ar more voluminous, and but little less ancient, is the ook of
einster, said to have been compiled in the early part of the twelfth
century by inn mac Gorman, ishop of ildare. his also contains an
account of Cuchulainnâ€s mighty deeds which supplements the older version
in the ook of the un Cow. f somewhat less importance from the point
of view of the student of Gaelic mythology come the ook of allymote
and the Yellow ook of ecan, belonging to the end of the fourteenth
century, and the ooks of ecan and of ismore, both attributed to the
fifteenth. esides these six great collections, there survive many other
manuscripts which also contain ancient mythical lore. In one of these,
dating from the fifteenth century, is to be found the story of the
attle of Moytura, fought between the gods of Ireland and their enemies,
the omors, or demons of the deep sea.

he cottish manuscripts, preserved in the Advocatesâ€ ibrary at
dinburgh, date back in some cases as far as the fourteenth century,
though the maority of them belong to the fifteenth and sixteenth. hey
corroborate the Irish documents, add to the Cuchulainn saga, and make a
more special subect of the other heroic cycle, that which relates the
not less wonderful deeds of inn, ssian, and the enians. hey also
contain stories of other characters, who, more ancient than either inn
or Cuchulainn, are the uatha  anann, the godtribe of the ancient
Gaels.

he Welsh documents cover about the same period as the Irish and the
cottish. our of these stand out from the rest, as most important. he
oldest is the lack ook of Caermarthen, which dates from the third
uarter of the twelfth century the ook of Aneurin, which was written
late in the thirteenth the ook of aliesin, assigned to the
fourteenth and the ed ook of ergest, compiled by various persons
during that century and the one following it. he first three of these
â€our Ancient ooks of Walesâ€ are small in size, and contain poems
attributed to the great traditional bards of the sixth century, Myrddin,
aliesin, and Aneurin. he lastâ€”the ed ook of ergestâ€”is far larger.
In it are to be found Welsh translations of the ritish Chronicles the
oftmentioned riads, verses celebrating famous traditionary persons or
things ancient poems attributed to lywarch n and, of priceless
value to any study of our subect, the socalled Mabinogion, stories in
which large portions of the old ritish mythology are worked up into
romantic form.

he whole bulk, therefore, of the native literature bearing upon the
mythology of the ritish Islands may be attributed to a period which
lasted from the beginning of the twelfth century to the end of the
sixteenth. ut even the commencement of this era will no doubt seem far
too late a day to allow authenticity to matter which ought to have
vastly preceded it. he date, however, merely marks the final redaction
of the contents of the manuscripts into the form in which they now
exist, without bearing at all upon the time of their authorship.
Avowedly copies of ancient poems and tales from much older manuscripts,
the present books no more fix the period of the original composition of
their contents than the presence of a portion of the Canterbury ales
in a modern anthology of nglish poetry would assign Chaucer to the
present year of grace.

his may be proved both directly and inferentially. In some
instancesâ€”as in that of an elegy upon aint Columba in the ook of the
un Cowâ€”the dates of authorship are actually given. In others, we may
depend upon evidence which, if not uite so absolute, is nearly as
convincing. ven where the writer does not state that he is copying from
older manuscripts, it is obvious that this must have been the case, from
the glosses in his version. he scribes of the earlier Gaelic
manuscripts very often found, in the documents from which they
themselves were copying, words so archaic as to be unintelligible to the
readers of their own period. o render them comprehensible, they were
obliged to insert marginal notes which explained these obsolete words by
reference to other manuscripts more ancient still. ften the medival
copyists have ignorantly moved these notes from the margin into the
text, where they remain, like philological fossils, to give evidence of
previous forms of life. he documents from which they were taken have
perished, leaving the medival copies as their sole record. In the Welsh
Mabinogion the same process is apparent. eculiarities in the existing
manuscripts show plainly enough that they must have been copied from
some more archaic text. esides this, they are, as they at present
stand, obviously made up of earlier tales pieced together. Almost as
clearly as the Gaelic manuscripts, the Welsh point us back to older and
more primitive forms.

he ancient legends of the Gael and the riton are thus shown to have
been no mere inventions of scholarly monks in the Middle Ages. We have
now to trace, if possible, the date, not necessarily of their first
appearance on menâ€s lips, but of their first redaction into writing in
approximately the form in which we have them now.

Circumstantial evidence can be adduced to prove that the most important
portions both of Gaelic and ritish early literature can be safely
relegated to a period of several centuries prior to their nowexisting
record. ur earliest version of the episode of the in  Chuailgn,
which is the nucleus and centre of the ancient Gaelic heroic cycle of
which Cuchulainn, fortissimus heros cotorum, is the principal figure,
is found in the twelfthcentury ook of the un Cow. ut legend tells us
that at the beginning of the seventh century the aga had not only been
composed, but had actually become so obsolete as to have been forgotten
by the bards. heir leader, one enchan orpeist, a historical
character, and chief bard of Ireland at that time, obtained permission
from the aints to call ergus, Cuchulainnâ€s contemporary, and a chief
actor in the â€aidâ€, from the dead, and received from the resurrected
hero a true and full version. his tradition, dealing with a real
personage, surely shows that the story of the in was known before
the time of enchan, and probably preserves the fact, either that his
version of Cuchulainnâ€s famous deeds became the accepted one, or that he
was the first to reduce it to writing. An eually suggestive
consideration approximately fixes for us the earliest redaction of the
Welsh mythological prose tales called the â€Mabinogionâ€, or, more
correctly speaking, the â€our ranches of the Mabinogiâ€. In none of
these is there the slightest mention, or apparently the least knowledge,
of Arthur, around whom and whose supposed contemporaries centres the
mass of ritish legend as it was transmitted by the Welsh to the
ormans. hese mysterious mythological records must in all probability,
therefore, antedate the Arthurian cycle of myth, which was already being
put into form in the sixth century. n the other hand, the characters of
the â€our ranchesâ€ are mentioned without commentâ€”as though they were
personages with whom no one could fail to be familiarâ€”in the supposed
sixthcentury poems contained in those â€our Ancient ooks of Walesâ€ in
which are found the first meagre references to the ritish hero.

uch considerations as these throw back, with reasonable certainty, the
existence of the Irish and Welsh poems and prose tales, in something
like their present shape, to a period antedating the seventh century.

ut this, again, means only that the myths, traditions, and legends were
current at that to us early, but to them, in their actual substance,
late date, in literary form. A mythology must always be far older than
the oldest verses and stories that celebrate it. laborate poems and
sagas are not made in a day, or in a year. he legends of the Gaelic and
ritish gods and heroes could not have sprung, like Athena from the head
of eus, fullborn out of some poetâ€s brain. he bard who first put them
into artistic shape was setting down the primitive traditions of his
race. We may therefore venture to describe them as not of the twelfth
century or of the seventh, but as of a prehistoric and immemorial
antiuity.

Internal evidence bears this out. An examination of both the Gaelic and
ritish legendary romances shows, under embellishing details added by
later hands, an inner core of primeval thought which brings them into
line with the similar ideas of other races in the earliest stage of
culture. heir â€local colourâ€ may be that of their last â€editorâ€, but
their â€plotsâ€ are premedival, preChristian, prehistoric. he
characters of early Gaelic legend belong to the same stamp of
imagination that created lympian and itan, sir and tun. We must go
far to the back of civilized thought to find parallels to such a story
as that in which the ritish sungod, struck by a rival in love with a
poisoned spear, is turned into an eagle, from whose wound great pieces
of carrion are continually failing.

his aspect of the Celtic literary records was clearly seen, and
elouently expressed, by Matthew Arnold in his tudy of Celtic
iterature. e was referring to the Welsh side, but his image holds
good eually for the Gaelic. â€he first thing that strikes oneâ€, he
says, â€in reading the Mabinogion is how evidently the medival
storyteller is pillaging an antiuity of which he does not fully
possess the secret he is like a peasant building his hut on the site of
alicarnassus or phesus he builds, but what he builds is full of
materials of which he knows not the history, or knows by a glimmering
tradition merely stones â€not of this buildingâ€, but of an older
architecture, greater, cunninger, more maestical.â€ is heroes â€are no
medival personages they belong to an older, pagan, mythological
worldâ€. o, too, with the figures, however euhemerized, of the three
great Gaelic cycles that of the uatha  anann, of the eroes of
lster, of inn and the enians. heir divinity outshines their
humanity through their masks may be seen the faces of gods.

Yet, gods as they are, they had taken on the semblance of mortality by
the time their histories were fixed in the form in which we have them
now. heir earliest records, if those could be restored to us, would
doubtless show them eternal and undying, changing their shapes at will,
but not passing away. ut the postChristian copyists, whether Irish or
Welsh, would not countenance this. ence we have the singular paradox of
the deaths of Immortals. here is hardly one of the figures of either
the Gaelic or the ritish antheon whose demise is not somewhere
recorded. sually they fell in the unceasing battles between the
divinities of darkness and of light. heir deaths in earlier cycles of
myth, however, do not preclude their appearance in later ones. nly,
indeed, with the closing of the lips of the last mortal who preserved
his tradition can the life of a god be truly said to end.

                    W W  â€ACI Iâ€


ut, before proceeding to recount the myths of the â€Ancient ritonsâ€, it
will be well to decide what people, exactly, we mean by that loose but
convenient phrase. We have, all of us, vague ideas of Ancient ritons,
recollected, doubtless, from our schoolbooks. here we saw their
pictures as, painted with woad, they paddled coracles, or drove scythed
chariots through legions of astonished omans. heir ruids,
whitebearded and wearing long, white robes, cut the mistletoe with a
golden sickle at the time of the full moon, or, less innocently
employed, made bonfires of human beings shut up in gigantic figures of
wickerwork.

uch picturesue details were little short of the sumtotal, not only of
our own knowledge of the subect, but also of that of our teachers.
ractically all their information concerning the ancient inhabitants of
ritain was taken from the Commentaries of ulius Caesar. o far as it
went, it was no doubt correct but it did not go far. Caesarâ€s interest
in our ritish ancestors was that of a general who was his own
warcorrespondent rather than that of an exhaustive and painstaking
scientist. It has been reserved for modern archologists, philologists,
and ethnologists to give us a fuller account of the Ancient ritons.

he inhabitants of our islands previous to the oman invasion are
generally described as â€Celtsâ€. ut they must have been largely a mixed
race and the people with whom they mingled must have modified to
someâ€”and perhaps to a largeâ€”extent their physiue, their customs, and
their language.

peculation has run somewhat wild over the uestion of the composition
of the arly ritons. ut out of the clash of rival theories there
emerges oneâ€”and one onlyâ€”which may be considered as scientifically
established. We have certain proof of two distinct human stocks in the
ritish Islands at the time of the oman Conuest and so great an
authority as rofessor uxley has given his opinion that there is no
evidence of any others.

he earliest of these two races would seem to have inhabited our islands
from the most ancient times, and may, for our purpose, be described as
aboriginal. It was the people that built the â€long barrowsâ€ and which
is variously called by ethnologists the Iberian, Mediterranean, erber,
asue, ilurian, or uskarian race. In physiue it was short, swarthy,
darkhaired, darkeyed, and longskulled its language belonged to the
class called â€amiticâ€, the surviving types of which are found among the
Gallas, Abyssinians, erbers, and other orth African tribes and it
seems to have come originally from some part either of astern,
orthern, or Central Africa. preading thence, it was probably the first
people to inhabit the alley of the ile, and it sent offshoots into
yria and Asia Minor. he earliest ellenes found it in Greece under the
name of â€elasgoiâ€ the earliest atins in Italy, as the â€truscansâ€
and the ebrews in alestine, as the â€ittitesâ€. It spread northward
through urope as far as the altic, and westward, along the Atlas
chain, to pain, rance, and our own islands.0 In many countries it
reached a comparatively high level of civilization, but in ritain its
development must have been early checked. We can discern it as an
agricultural rather than a pastoral people, still in the tone Age,
dwelling in totemistic tribes on hills whose summits it fortified
elaborately, and whose slopes it cultivated on what is called the
â€terrace systemâ€, and having a primitive culture which ethnologists
think to have much resembled that of the present hilltribes of outhern
India. It held our islands till the coming of the Celts, who fought
with the aborigines, dispossessed them of the more fertile parts,
subugated them, even amalgamated with them, but certainly never
extirpated them. In the time of the omans they were still practically
independent in outh Wales. In Ireland they were long unconuered, and
are found as allies rather than serfs of the Gaels, ruling their own
provinces, and preserving their own customs and religion. or, in spite
of all the successive invasions of Great ritain and Ireland, are they
yet extinct, or so merged as to have lost their type, which is still the
predominant one in many parts of the west both of ritain and Ireland,
and is believed by some ethnologists to be generally upon the increase
all over ngland.

he second of the two races was the exact opposite to the first. It was
the tall, fair, lighthaired, blue or grayeyed, broadheaded people
called, popularly, the â€Celtsâ€, who belonged in speech to the â€Aryanâ€
family, their language finding its affinities in atin, Greek, eutonic,
lavic, the end of Ancient ersia, and the anscrit of Ancient India.
Its original home was probably somewhere in Central urope, along the
course of the upper anube, or in the region of the Alps. he â€round
barrowsâ€ in which it buried its dead, or deposited their burnt ashes,
differ in shape from the â€long barrowsâ€ of the earlier race. It was in a
higher stage of culture than the â€Iberiansâ€, and introduced into ritain
bronze and silver, and, perhaps, some of the more lately domesticated
animals.

oth Iberians and Celts were divided into numerous tribes, but there is
nothing to show that there was any great diversity among the former. It
is otherwise with the Celts, who were separated into two main branches
which came over at different times. he earliest were the Goidels, or
Gaels the second, the rythons, or ritons. etween these two branches
there was not only a dialectical, but probably, also, a considerable
physical difference. ome anthropologists even postulate a different
shape of skull. Without necessarily admitting this, there is reason to
suppose a difference of build and of colour of hair. With regard to
this, we have the evidence of atin writersâ€”of acitus,2 who tells us
that the â€Caledoniansâ€ of the orth differed from the outhern ritons
in being largerlimbed and redderhaired, and of trabo, who
described the tribes in the interior of ritain as taller than the
Gaulish colonists on the coast, with hair less yellow and limbs more
loosely knit. ually do the classic authorities agree in recognizing
the â€iluresâ€ of outh Wales as an entirely different race from any
other in ritain. he dark complexions and curly hair of these Iberians
seemed to acitus to prove them immigrants from pain.

rofessor hys also puts forward evidence to show that the Goidels and
the rythons had already separated before they first left Gaul for our
islands. e finds them as two distinct peoples there. We do not
expect so much nowadays from â€the merest schoolboyâ€ as we did in
Macaulayâ€s time, but even the modern descendant of that paragon could
probably tell us that all Gaul was divided into three parts, one of
which was inhabited by the elgae, another by the Auitani, and the
third by those who called themselves Celtae, but were termed Galli by
the omans and that they all differed from one another in language,
customs, and laws. f these, rofessor hys identifies the elgae
with the rythons, and the Celtae with the Goidels, the third people,
the Auitani, being nonCeltic and nonAryan, part of the great
amiticspeaking Iberian stock. he Celtae, with their Goidelic
dialect of Celtic, which survives today in the Gaelic languages of
Ireland, cotland, and the Isle of Man, were the first to come over to
ritain, pushed forward, probably, by the elgae, who, Caesar tells us,
were the bravest of the Gauls. ere they conuered the native
Iberians, driving them out of the fertile parts into the rugged
districts of the north and west. ater came the elgae themselves,
compelled by press of population and they, bringing better weapons and
a higher civilization, treated the Goidels as those had treated the
Iberians. hus harried, the Goidels probably combined with the Iberians
against what was now the common foe, and became to a large degree
amalgamated with them. he result was that during the oman domination
the ritish Islands were roughly divided with regard to race as follows
he rythons, or second Celtic race, held all ritain south of the
weed, with the exception of the extreme west, while the first Celtic
race, the Goidelic, had most of Ireland, as well as the Isle of Man,
Cumberland, the West ighlands, Cornwall, evon, and orth Wales. orth
of the Grampians lived the icts, who were probably more or less
Goidelicized Iberians, the aboriginal race also holding out, unmixed, in
outh Wales and parts of Ireland.

It is now time to decide what, for the purposes of this book, it will be
best to call the two different branches of the Celts, and their
languages. With such familiar terms as â€Gaelâ€ and â€ritonâ€, â€Gaelicâ€ and
â€ritishâ€, ready to our hands, it seems pedantic to insist upon the more
technical â€Goidelâ€ and â€rythonâ€, â€Goidelicâ€ and â€rythonicâ€. he
difficulty is that the words â€Gaelâ€ and â€Gaelicâ€ have been so long
popularly used to designate only the modern â€Goidelsâ€ of cotland and
their language, that they may create confusion when also applied to the
people and languages of Ireland and the Isle of Man. imilarly, the
words â€ritonâ€ and â€ritishâ€ have come to mean, at the present day, the
people of the whole of the ritish Islands, though they at first only
signified the inhabitants of ngland, Central Wales, the owlands of
cotland, and the rythonic colony in rittany. owever, the words
â€Goidelâ€ and â€rythonâ€, with their derivatives, are so clumsy that it
will probably prove best to use the neater terms. In this volume,
therefore, the â€Goidelsâ€ of Ireland, cotland, and the Isle of Man are
our â€Gaelsâ€ and the â€rythonsâ€ of ngland and Wales are our â€ritonsâ€.

We get the earliest accounts of the life of the inhabitants of the
ritish Islands from two sources. he first is a foreign one, that of
the atin writers. ut the omans only really knew the outhern ritons,
whom they describe as similar in physiue and customs to the Continental
Gauls, with whom, indeed, they considered them to be identical. At
the time they wrote, colonies of elgae were still settling upon the
coasts of ritain opposite to Gaul.20 oman information grew scantier
as it approached the Wall, and of the orthern tribes they seem to have
had only such knowledge as they gathered through occasional warfare with
them. hey describe them as entirely barbarous, naked and tattooed,
living by the chase alone, without towns, houses, or fields, without
government or family life, and regarding iron as an ornament of value,
as other, more civilized peoples regarded gold.2 As for Ireland, it
never came under their direct observation, and we are entirely dependent
upon its native writers for information as to the manners and customs of
the Gaels. It may be considered convincing proof of the authenticity of
the descriptions of life contained in the ancient Gaelic manuscripts
that they corroborate so completely the observations of the atin
writers upon the ritons and Gauls. eading the two side by side, we may
largely reconstruct the common civilization of the Celts.

oughly speaking, one may compare it with the civilization of the
Greeks, as described by omer.22 oth peoples were in the tribal and
pastoral stage of culture, in which the chiefs are the great
cattleowners round whom their less wealthy fellows gather. oth wear
much the same attire, use the same kind of weapons, and fight in the
same mannerâ€”from the warchariot, a vehicle already obsolete even in
Ireland by the first century of the Christian era. attles are fought
singlehanded between chiefs, the illarmed common people contributing
little to their result, and less to their history. uch chiefs are said
to be divinely descendedâ€”sons, even, of the immortal gods. heir
tremendous feats are sung by the bards, who, like the omeric poets,
were privileged persons, inferior only to the warlord. Ancient Greek
and Ancient Celt had very much the same conceptions of life, both as
regards this world and the next.

We may gather much detailed information of the early inhabitants of the
ritish Islands from our various authorities.2 heir clothes, which
consisted, according to the atin writers, of a blouse with sleeves,
trousers fitting closely round the ankles, and a shawl or cloak,
fastened at the shoulder with a brooch, were made either of thick felt
or of woven cloth dyed with various brilliant colours. he writer
iodorus tells us that they were crossed with little suares and lines,
â€as though they had been sprinkled with flowersâ€. hey were, in fact,
like â€tartansâ€, and we may believe arro, who tells us that they â€made a
gaudy showâ€. he men alone seem to have worn hats, which were of soft
felt, the womenâ€s hair being uncovered, and tied in a knot behind. In
time of battle, the men also dispensed with any headcovering, brushing
their abundant hair forward into a thick mass, and dyeing it red with a
soap made of goatâ€s fat and beech ashes, until they looked says
Ciceroâ€s tutor osidonius, who visited ritain about 0 .C. less like
human beings than wild men of the woods. oth sexes were fond of
ornaments, which took the form of gold bracelets, rings, pins, and
brooches, and of beads of amber, glass, and et. heir knives, daggers,
spearheads, axes, and swords were made of bronze or iron their shields
were the same round target used by the ighlanders at the battle of
Culloden and they seem also to have had a kind of lasso to which a
hammershaped ball was attached, and which they used as the Gauchos of
outh America use their bola. heir warchariots were made of wicker,
the wooden wheels being armed with sickles of bronze. hese were drawn
either by two or four horses, and were large enough to hold several
persons in each. tanding in these, they rushed along the enemyâ€s lines,
hurling darts, and driving the scythes against all who came within
reach. he omans were much impressed by the skill of the drivers, who
â€could check their horses at full speed on a steep incline, and turn
them in an instant, and could run along the pole, and stand on the yoke,
and then get back into their chariots again without a momentâ€s
delayâ€.2

With these accounts of the oman writers we may compare the picture of
the Gaelic hero, Cuchulainn, as the ancient Irish writers describe him
dressed and armed for battle. Glorified by the bard, he yet wears
essentially the same costume and euipment which the classic historians
and geographers described more soberly. â€is gorgeous raiment that he
wore in great conventionsâ€ consisted of â€a fair crimson tunic of five
plies and fringed, with a long pin of white silver, goldenchased and
patterned, shining as if it had been a luminous torch which for its
blazing property and brilliance men might not endure to see. ext his
skin, a bodyvest of silk, bordered and fringed all round with gold,
with silver, and with white bronze, which vest came as far as the upper
edge of his russetcoloured kilt.... About his neck were a hundred
linklets of red gold that flashed again, with pendants hanging from
them. is headgear was adorned with a hundred mixed carbuncle ewels,
strung.â€ e carried â€a trusty special shield, in hue dark crimson, and
in its circumference armed with a pure white silver rim. At his left
side a long and goldenhilted sword. eside him, in the chariot, a
lengthy spear together with a keen, aggressionboding avelin, fitted
with hurling thong, with rivets of white bronze.â€2 Another passage of
Gaelic saga describes his chariot. It was made of fine wood, with
wickerwork, moving on wheels of white bronze. It had a high rounded
frame of creaking copper, a strong curved yoke of gold, and a pole of
white silver, with mountings of white bronze. he yellow reins were
plaited, and the shafts were as hard and straight as swordblades.2

In like manner the ancient Irish writers have made glorious the halls
and fortresses of their mythical kings. ike the palaces of riam, of
Menelaus, and of dysseus, they gleam with gold and gems. Conchobar,2
the legendary ing of lster in its golden age, had three such â€housesâ€
at main Macha. f the one called the â€ed ranchâ€, we are told that it
contained nine compartments of red yew, partitioned by walls of bronze,
all grouped around the kingâ€s private chamber, which had a ceiling of
silver, and bronze pillars adorned with gold and carbuncles.2 ut the
far less magnificent accounts of the atin writers have, no doubt, more
truth in them than such lavish pictures. hey described the ritons they
knew as living in villages of beehive huts, roofed with fern or thatch,
from which, at the approach of an enemy, they retired to the local
dn. his, so far from being elaborate, merely consisted of a round or
oval space fenced in with palisades and earthworks, and situated either
upon the top of a hill or in the midst of a not easily traversable
morass.2 We may see the remains of such strongholds in many parts of
nglandâ€”notable ones are the â€castlesâ€ of Amesbury, Avebury, and ld
arum in Wiltshire, aint Catherineâ€s ill, near Winchester, and aint
Georgeâ€s ill, in urreyâ€”and it is probable that, in spite of the Celtic
praisers of past days, the â€palacesâ€ of main Macha and of ara were
very like them.

he Celtic customs were, like the omeric, those of the primitive world.
All land though it may have theoretically belonged to the chief was
cultivated in common. his community of possessions is stated by
Caesar0 to have extended to their wives but the imputation cannot be
said to have been proved. n the contrary, in the stories of both
branches of the Celtic race, women seem to have taken a higher place in
menâ€s estimation, and to have enoyed far more personal liberty, than
among the omeric Greeks. he idea may have arisen from a
misunderstanding of some of the curious Celtic customs. escent seems to
have been traced through the maternal rather than through the paternal
line, a very unAryan procedure which some believe to have been borrowed
from another race. he parental relation was still further lessened by
the custom of sending children to be brought up outside the family in
which they were born, so that they had fosterparents to whom they were
as much, or even more, attached than to their natural ones.

heir political state, mirroring their family life, was not less
primitive. here was no central tribunal. isputes were settled within
the families in which they occurred, while, in the case of graver
inuries, the inured party or his nearest relation could kill the
culprit or exact a fine from him. As families increased in number, they
became petty tribes, often at war with one another. A defeated tribe had
to recognize the sovereignty of the head man of the conuering tribe,
and a succession of such victories exalted him into the position of a
chief of his district. ut even then, though his decision was the whole
of the law, he was little more than the mouthpiece of public opinion.

he ancient inhabitants of ritainâ€”the Gaelic and ritish Celtsâ€”have
been already described as forming a branch of what are roughly called
the â€Aryansâ€. his name has, however, little reference to race, and
really signifies the speakers of a group of languages which can be all
shown to be connected, and to descend remotely from a single sourceâ€”a
hypothetical mothertongue spoken by a hypothetical people which we term
â€Aryanâ€, or, more correctly, â€Indouropeanâ€. his primeval speech,
evolved, probably, upon some part of the great plain which stretches
from the mountains of Central urope to the mountains of Central Asia,
has spread, superseding, or amalgamating with the tongues of other
races, until branches of it are spoken over almost the whole of urope
and a great portion of Asia. All the various atin, Greek, lavic,
eutonic, and Celtic languages are â€Aryanâ€, as well as ersian and other
Asiatic dialects derived from the ancient â€endâ€, and the numerous
Indian languages which trace their origin to anscrit.

ot very long ago, it was supposed that this common descent of language
involved a common descent of blood. A real brotherhood was
enthusiastically claimed for all the principal uropean nations, who
were also invited to recognize indus and ersians as their longlost
cousins. ince then, it has been conceded that, while the Aryan speech
survived, though greatly modified, the Aryan blood might well have
disappeared, diluted beyond recognition by crossing with the other races
whom the Aryans conuered, or among whom they more or less peacefully
settled. As a matter of fact, there are no uropean nationsâ€”perhaps no
people at all except a few remote savage tribesâ€”which are not made up of
the most diverse elements. Aryan and nonAryan long ago blended
inextricably, to form by their fusion new peoples.

ut, ust as the Aryan speech influenced the new languages, and the
Aryan customs the new civilizations, so we can still discern in the
religions of the Aryanspeaking nations similar ideas and expressions
pointing to an original source of mythological conceptions. ence,
whether we investigate the mythology of the indus, the Greeks, the
eutons, or the Celts, we find the same mythological groundwork. In
each, we see the powers of nature personified, and endowed with human
form and attributes, though bearing, with few exceptions, different
names. ike the edic brahmans, the Greek and atin poets, and the orse
scalds, the Celtic bardsâ€”whether Gaels or ritonsâ€”imagined the sky, the
sun, the moon, the earth, the sea, and the dark underworld, as well as
the mountains, the streams and the woods, to be ruled by beings like
their own chiefs, but infinitely more powerful every passion, as War
and ove, and every art, as oetry and mithcraft, had its divine
founder, teacher, and exponent and of all these deities and their
imagined children, they wove the poetical and allegorical romances which
form the subect of the present volume.

ike other nations, too, whether Aryan or nonAryan, the Celts had,
besides their mythology, a religion. It is not enough to tell tales of
shadowy gods they must be made visible by sculpture, housed in groves
or temples, served with ritual, and propitiated with sacrifices, if one
is to hope for their favours. very cult must have its priests living by
the altar.

he priests of the Celts are wellknown to us by name as the â€ruidsâ€â€”a
word derived from a root  which signifies a tree, and especially the
oak, in several Aryan languages. his is generallyâ€”though not by all
scholarsâ€”taken as proving that they paid an especial veneration to the
king of trees. It is true that the mistletoeâ€”that strange parasite upon
the oakâ€”was prominent among their â€herbs of powerâ€, and played a part in
their ritual2 but this is eually true of other Aryan nations. y
the orse it was held sacred to the god alder, while the omans
believed it to be the â€golden boughâ€ that gave access to ades.

he accounts both of the atin and Gaelic writers give us a fairly
complete idea of the nature of the ruids, and especially of the high
estimation in which they were held. hey were at once the priests, the
physicians, the wizards, the diviners, the theologians, the scientists,
and the historians of their tribes. All spiritual power and all human
knowledge were vested in them, and they ranked second only to the kings
and chiefs. hey were freed from all contribution to the tate, whether
by tribute or service in war, so that they might the better apply
themselves to their divine offices. heir decisions were absolutely
final, and those who disobeyed them were laid under a terrible
excommunication or â€boycottâ€. Classic writers tell us how they
lorded it in Gaul, where, no doubt, they borrowed splendour by imitating
their more civilized neighbours. Men of the highest rank were proud to
cast aside the insignia of mere mortal honour to oin the company of
those who claimed to be the direct mediators with the skygod and the
thundergod, and who must have resembled the ecclesiastics of medival
urope in the days of their greatest power, combining, like them,
spiritual and temporal dignities, and possessing the highest culture of
their age. Yet it was not among these ruids of Gaul, with their
splendid temples and vestments and their elaborate rituals, that the
metropolis of ruidism was to be sought. We learn from Caesar that the
Gallic ruids believed their religion to have come to them, originally,
from ritain, and that it was their practice to send their â€theological
studentsâ€ across the Channel to learn its doctrines at their purest
source. o trace a cult backwards is often to take a retrograde
course in culture, and it was no doubt in ritainâ€”which liny the lder
tells us â€might have taught magic to ersiaâ€â€”that the sufficiently
primitive and savage rites of the ruids of Gaul were preserved in their
still more savage and primitive forms. It is curious corroboration of
this alleged ritish origin of ruidism that the ancient Irish also
believed their ruidism to have come from the sister island. heir
heroes and seers are described as only gaining the highest knowledge by
travelling to Alba. owever this may be, we may take it as certain
that this ruidism was the accepted religion of the Celtic race.

Certain scholars look deeper for its origin, holding its dark
superstitions and savage rites to bear the stamp of lower minds than
those of the poetic and manly Celts. rofessor hys inclines to see
three forms of religion in the ritish Islands at the time of the oman
invasion the â€ruidismâ€ of the Iberian aborigines the pure polytheism
of the rythons, who, having come later into the country, had mixed but
little with the natives and the mingled Aryan and nonAryan cults of
the Goidels, who were already largely amalgamated with them. ut
many authorities dissent from this view, and, indeed, we are not obliged
to postulate borrowing from tribes in a lower state of culture, to
explain primitive and savage features underlying a higher religion. he
â€Aryanâ€ nations must have passed, eually with all others, through a
state of pure savagery and we know that the religion of the Greeks, in
many respects so lofty, sheltered features and legends as barbarous as
any that can be attributed to the Celts.

f the famous teaching of the ruids we know little, owing to their
habit of never allowing their doctrines to be put into writing. Caesar,
however, roughly records its scope. â€As one of their leading dogmasâ€, he
says, â€they inculcate this that souls are not annihilated, but pass
after death from one body to another, and they hold that by this
teaching men are much encouraged to valour, through disregarding the
fear of death. hey also discuss and impart to the young many things
concerning the heavenly bodies and their movements, the size of the
world and of our earth, natural science, and of the influence and power
of the immortal gods.â€0 he omans seem to have held their wisdom in
some awe, though it is not unlikely that the ruids themselves borrowed
whatever knowledge they may have had of science and philosophy from the
classical culture. hat their creed of transmigration was not, however,
merely taken over from the Greeks seems certain from its appearance in
the ancient Gaelic myths. ot only the â€shapeshiftingâ€ common to the
magic stories of all nations, but actual reincarnation was in the power
of privileged beings. he hero Cuchulainn was urged by the men of lster
to marry, because they knew â€that his rebirth would be of himselfâ€,
and they did not wish so great a warrior to be lost to their tribe.
Another legend tells how the famous inn mac Coul was reborn, after two
hundred years, as an lster king called Mongan.2

uch ideas, however, belonged to the metaphysical side of ruidism. ar
more important to the practical primitive mind are ritual and sacrifice,
by the due performance of which the gods are persuaded or compelled to
grant earthâ€s increase and length of days to men. Among the ruids, this
humouring of the divinities took the shape of human sacrifice, and that
upon a scale which would seem to have been unsurpassed in horror even by
the most savage tribes of West Africa or olynesia. â€he whole Gaulish
nationâ€, says Caesar, â€is to a great degree devoted to superstitious
rites and on this account those who are afflicted with severe diseases,
or who are engaged in battles and dangers, either sacrifice human beings
for victims, or vow that they will immolate themselves, and these employ
the ruids as ministers for such sacrifices, because they think that,
unless the life of man be repaid for the life of man, the will of the
immortal gods cannot be appeased. hey also ordain national offerings of
the same kind. thers make wickerwork images of vast size, the limbs of
which they fill with living men and set on fire.â€

We find evidence of similarly awful customs in pagan Ireland. Among the
oldest Gaelic records are tracts called innsenchus, in which famous
places are enumerated, together with the legends relating to them. uch
topographies are found in several of the great Irish medival
manuscripts, and therefore, of course, received their final
transcription at the hands of Christian monks. ut these ecclesiastics
rarely tampered with compositions in elaborate verse. or can it be
imagined that any monastic scribe could have invented such a legend as
this one which describes the practice of human sacrifice among the
ancient Irish. he poem which is found in the ooks of einster, of
allymote, of ecan, and in a document called the ennes M.
records the reason why a spot near the present village of allymagauran,
in County Cavan, received the name of Mag lecht, the â€lain of
Adorationâ€.

        â€ere used to be
         A high idol with many fights,
         Which was named the Cromm Cruaich
         It made every tribe to be without peace.

        â€â€was a sad evil
         rave Gaels used to worship it.
         rom it they would not without tribute ask
         o be satisfied as to their portion of the hard world.

        â€e was their god,
         he withered Cromm with many mists,
         he people whom he shook over every host,
         he everlasting kingdom they shall not have.

        â€o him without glory
         hey would kill their piteous, wretched offspring
         With much wailing and peril,
         o pour their blood around Cromm Cruaich.

        â€Milk and corn
         hey would ask from him speedily
         In return for onethird of their healthy issue
         Great was the horror and the scare of him.

        â€o him
         oble Gaels would prostrate themselves,
         rom the worship of him, with many manslaughters,
         he plain is called â€Mag lechtâ€.

                                                

        â€hey did evil,
         hey beat their palms, they pounded their bodies,
         Wailing to the demon who enslaved them,
         hey shed falling showers of tears.

                                                

        â€Around Cromm Cruaich
         here the hosts would prostrate themselves
         hough he put them under deadly disgrace,
         heir name clings to the noble plain.

        â€In their ranks stood
         our times three stone idols
         o bitterly beguile the hosts,
         he figure of the Cromm was made of gold.

        â€ince the rule
         f erimon, the noble man of grace,
         here was worshipping of stones
         ntil the coming of good atrick of Macha.

        â€A sledgehammer to the Cromm
         e applied from crown to sole,
         e destroyed without lack of valour
         he feeble idol which was there.â€

uch, we gather from a tradition which we may deem authentic, was human
sacrifice in early Ireland. According to the uoted verse, one third of
the healthy children were slaughtered, presumably every year, to wrest
from the powers of nature the grain and grass upon which the tribes and
their cattle subsisted. In a prose dinnsenchus preserved in the ennes
M., there is a slight variant. â€â€is thereâ€, at Mag lecht, it
runs, â€was the king idol of rin, namely the Crom Croich, and around him
were twelve idols made of stones, but he was of gold. ntil atrickâ€s
advent he was the god of every folk that colonized Ireland. o him they
used to offer the firstlings of every issue and the chief scions of
every clan.â€ he same authority also tells us that these sacrifices were
made at â€alloweâ€enâ€, which took the place, in the Christian calendar,
of the heathen amhainâ€”â€ummerâ€s ndâ€â€”when the sunâ€s power waned, and
the strength of the gods of darkness, winter, and the underworld grew
great.

Who, then, was this bloodthirsty deity is name, Cromm Cruaich, means
the â€owed ne of the Moundâ€, and was evidently applied to him only
after his fall from godhead. It relates to the tradition that, at the
approach of the allconuering aint atrick, the â€demonâ€ fled from his
golden image, which thereupon sank forward in the earth in homage to the
power that had come to supersede it. ut from another source we
glean that the word cromm was a kind of pun upon cenn, and that the
real title of the â€king idol of rinâ€ was Cenn Cruaich, â€eadâ€ or
â€ordâ€ of the Mound. rofessor hys, in his Celtic eathendom,
suggests that he was probably the Gaelic heavengod, worshipped, like
the ellenic eus, upon â€high placesâ€, natural or artificial. At any
rate, we may see in him the god most revered by the Gaels, surrounded by
the other twelve chief members of their antheon.

It would appear probable that the Celtic tate worship was what is
called â€solarâ€. All its chief festivals related to points in the sunâ€s
progress, the euinoxes having been considered more important than the
solstices. It was at the spring euinox called by the Celts
â€eltaineâ€ in every nineteenth year that, we learn from iodorus
the icilian, a writer contemporary with ulius Caesar, Apollo himself
appeared to his worshippers, and was seen harping and dancing in the sky
until the rising of the leiades.0 he other corresponding festival
was â€amhainâ€, the autumn euinox. As eltaine marked the beginning
of summer, so amhain recorded its end. he summer solstice was also a
great Celtic feast. It was held at the beginning of August in honour of
the god called ugus by the Gauls, ugh by the Gaels, and leu by the
ritonsâ€”the panCeltic Apollo, and, probably, when the cult of the
wargod had fallen from its early prominence, the chief figure of the
common antheon.

It was doubtless at tonehenge that the ritish Apollo was thus seen
harping and dancing. hat marvellous structure well corresponds to
iodorusâ€s description of a â€magnificent temple of Apolloâ€ which he
locates â€in the centre of ritainâ€. â€It is a circular enclosure,â€ he
says, â€adorned with votive offerings and tablets with Greek inscriptions
suspended by travellers upon the walls. he rulers of the temple and
city are called â€oreadâ€2, and they take up the government from each
other according to the order of their tribes. he citizens are given up
to music, harping and chanting in honour of the sun.â€ tonehenge,
therefore, was a sacred religious centre, eually revered by and eually
belonging to all the ritish tribesâ€”a ome or erusalem of our ancient
paganism.

he same great gods were, no doubt, adored by all the Celts, not only of
Great ritain and Ireland, but of Continental Gaul as well. ometimes
they can be traced by name right across the ancient Celtic world. In
other cases, what is obviously the same personified power of nature is
found in various places with the same attributes, but with a different
title. esides these, there must have been a multitude of lesser gods,
worshipped by certain tribes alone, to whom they stood as ancestors and
guardians. â€I swear by the gods of my peopleâ€, was the ordinary oath of
a hero in the ancient Gaelic sagas. he aboriginal tribes must also have
had their gods, whether it be true or not that their religion influenced
the Celtic ruidism. rofessor hys inclines to see in the genii
locorum, the almost nameless spirits of well and river, mountain and
woodâ€”shadowy remnants of whose cults survive today,â€”members of a
swarming antheon of the older Iberians. hese local beings would in
no way conflict with the great Celtic naturegods, and the two worships
could exist side by side, both even claiming the same votary. It needs
the stern faith of monotheism to deny the existence of the gods of
others. olytheistic nations have seldom or never risen to such a
height. In their dealings with a conuered people, the conuerors
naturally held their own gods to be the stronger. till, it could not be
denied that the gods of the conuered were upon their own ground they
knew, so to speak, the country, and might have unguessed powers of doing
evil What if, to avenge their worshippers and themselves, they were to
make the land barren and useless to the conuerors o that conuering
pagan nations have usually been uite ready to stretch out the hand of
welcome to the deities of their new subects, to propitiate them by
sacrifice, and even to admit them within the pale of their own antheon.

his raises the uestion of the exact nationality of the gods whose
stories we are about to tell. Were they all Aryan, or did any of the
greater aboriginal deities climb up to take their place among the Gaelic
tribe of the goddess anu, or the ritish children of the goddess n
ome of the Celtic gods have seemed to scholars to bear signs of a
nonAryan origin. he point, however, is at present very obscure.
either does it much concern us. ust as the diverse deities of the
Greeksâ€”some Aryan and ellenic, some preAryan and elasgian, some
imported and emiticâ€”were all gathered into one great divine family, so
we may consider as members of one national lympus all these gods whose
legends make up â€he Mythology of the ritish Islandsâ€.

f the two Celtic races that settled in our islands, it is the earlier,
the Gaels, that has best preserved its old mythology. It is true that we
have in few cases such detailed account of the Gaelic gods as we gain of
the ellenic deities from the Greek poets, of the Indian evas from the
ig eda, or of the orse sir from the ddas. Yet none the less may we
draw from the ancient Irish manuscripts uite enough information to
enable us to set forth their figures with some clearness. We find them,
as might have been anticipated, very much like the divine hierarchies of
other Aryan peoples.

We also find them separated into two opposing camps, a division common
to all the Aryan religions. ust as the lympians struggled with the
Giants, the sir fought the tuns, and the evas the Asuras, so there
is warfare in the Gaelic spiritual world between two superhuman hosts.
n one side are ranged the gods of day, light, life, fertility, wisdom,
and good on the other, the demons of night, darkness, death,
barrenness, and evil. he first were the great spirits symbolizing the
beneficial aspects of nature and the arts and intelligence of man the
second were the hostile powers thought to be behind such baneful
manifestations as storm and fog, drought and disease. he first are
ranged as a divine family round a goddess called anu, from whom they
took their wellknown name of uatha  anann, â€ribeâ€ or â€olk
of the Goddess anuâ€. he second owned allegiance to a female divinity
called omnu their king, Indech, is described as her son, and they are
all called â€omnuâ€s godsâ€. he word â€omnuâ€ appears to have signified
the abyss or the deep sea, and the same idea is also expressed in
their betterknown name of â€omorsâ€, derived from two Gaelic words
meaning â€under seaâ€. he waste of water seems to have always
impressed the Celts with the sense of primeval ancientness it was
connected in their minds with vastness, darkness, and monstrous
birthsâ€”the very antithesis of all that was symbolized by the earth, the
sky, and the sun.

herefore the omors were held to be more ancient than the gods, before
whom they were, however, destined to fall in the end. ffspring of
â€Chaos and ld ightâ€, they were, for the most part, huge and deformed.
ome had but one arm and one leg apiece, while others had the heads of
goats, horses, or bulls. he most famous, and perhaps the most
terrible of them all was alor, whose father is said to have been one
uarainech, that is, the â€cowfacedâ€,0 and who combined in himself
the two classical rles of the Cyclops and the Medusa. hough he had two
eyes, one was always kept shut, for it was so venomous that it slew
anyone on whom its look fell. his malignant uality of alorâ€s eye was
not natural to him, but was the result of an accident. rged by
curiosity, he once looked in at the window of a house where his fatherâ€s
sorcerers were preparing a magic potion, and the poisonous smoke from
the cauldron reached his eye, infecting it with so much of its own
deadly nature as to make it disastrous to others. either god nor giant
seems to have been exempt from its dangers so that alor was only
allowed to live on condition that he kept his terrible eye shut. n days
of battle he was placed opposite to the enemy, the lid of the destroying
eye was lifted up with a hook, and its gaze withered all who stood
before it. he memory of alor and his eye still lingers in Ireland the
â€eye of alorâ€ is the name for what the peasantry of other countries
call the â€evil eyeâ€ stories are still told of alar eimann, or
â€alor of the Mighty lowsâ€ and â€alorâ€s Castleâ€ is the name of a
curious cliff on ory Island. his island, off the coast of onegal, was
the omorian outpost upon earth, their real abode being in the cold
depths of the sea.

his rule, however, as to the hideousness of the omors had its
exceptions. lathan, one of their chiefs, is described in an old
manuscript as of magnificent presenceâ€”a Miltonic prince of darkness. â€A
man of fairest form,â€ it says, â€with golden hair down to his shoulders.
e wore a mantle of gold braid over a shirt interwoven with threads of
gold. ive golden necklaces were round his neck, and a brooch of gold
with a shining precious stone thereon was on his breast. e carried two
silver spears with rivets of bronze, and his sword was goldenhilted and
goldenstudded.â€ or was his son less handsome. is name was ress,
which means â€beautifulâ€, and we are told that every beautiful thing in
Ireland, â€whether plain, or fortress, or ale, or torch, or woman, or
manâ€, was compared with him, so that men said of them, â€that is a
ressâ€.2

alor, ress, and lathan are the three omorian personages whose
figures, seen through the mists of antiuity, show clearest to us. ut
they are only a few out of many, nor are they the oldest. We can learn,
however, nothing but a few names of any ancestors of the Gaelic giants.
his is eually true of the Gaelic gods. hose we know are evidently not
without parentage, but the names of their fathers are no more than
shadows following into oblivion the figures they designated. he most
ancient divinity of whom we have any knowledge is anu herself, the
goddess from whom the whole hierarchy of gods received its name of
uatha  anann. he was also called Anu or Ana, and her name still
clings to two wellknown mountains near illarney, which, though now
called simply â€he apsâ€, were known formerly as the â€aps of Anaâ€.
he was the universal mother â€well she used to cherish the godsâ€, says
the commentator of a ninthcentury Irish glossary. er husband is
never mentioned by name, but one may assume him, from ritish analogies,
to have been il, known to Gaelic tradition as a god of ades, a kind
of Celtic is ater from whom sprang the first men. anu herself
probably represented the earth and its fruitfulness, and one might
compare her with the Greek emeter. All the other gods are, at least by
title, her children. he greatest of these would seem to have been
uada, called Argetlm, or â€e of the ilver andâ€. e was at once the
Gaelic eus, or upiter, and their wargod for among primitive nations,
to whom success in war is allimportant, the god of battles is the
supreme god. Among the Gauls, Camulus, whose name meant
â€eavenâ€, was identified by the omans with Mars and other such
instances come readily to the mind. e was possessed of an invincible
sword, one of the four chief treasures of the uatha  anann, over
whom he was twice king and there is little doubt that he was one of the
most important gods of both the Gaels and the ritons, for his name is
spread over the whole of the ritish Isles, which we may surmise the
Celts conuered under his auspices. We may picture him as a more savage
Mars, delighting in battle and slaughter, and worshipped, like his
Gaulish affinities, eutates and esus, of whom the atin poet ucan
tells us, with human sacrifices, shared in by his female consorts, who,
we may imagine, were not more merciful than himself, or than that
Gaulish aranis whose cult was â€no gentler than that of the cythian
ianaâ€, and who completes ucanâ€s triad as a fit companion to the
â€pitiless eutatesâ€ and the â€horrible esusâ€. f these warlike
goddesses there were fiveâ€”ea, the â€atefulâ€, emon, the â€enomousâ€,
adb, the â€uryâ€, Macha, a personification of â€battleâ€, and, over all of
them, the Morrg, or â€Great ueenâ€. his supreme wargoddess of the
Gaels, who resembles a fiercer er, perhaps symbolized the moon, deemed
by early races to have preceded the sun, and worshipped with magical and
cruel rites. he is represented as going fully armed, and carrying two
spears in her hand. As with Ars and oseidon in the â€Iliadâ€,
her battlecry was as loud as that of ten thousand men. Wherever there
was war, either among gods or men, she, the great ueen, was present,
either in her own shape or in her favourite disguise, that of a â€hoodieâ€
or carrion crow. An old poem shows her inciting a warrior

              â€ver his head is shrieking
                 A lean hag, uickly hopping
               ver the points of the weapons and shields
                 he is the grayhaired Morrgâ€.0

With her, ea and emon, adb and Macha also hovered over the fighters,
inspiring them with the madness of battle. All of these were sometimes
called by the name of â€adbâ€. An account of the attle of Clontarf,
fought by rian oru, in 0, against the orsemen, gives a gruesome
picture of what the Gaels believed to happen in the spiritual world when
battle lowered and menâ€s blood was aflame. â€here arose a wild,
impetuous, precipitate, mad, inexorable, furious, dark, lacerating,
merciless, combative, contentious badb, which was shrieking and
fluttering over their heads. And there arose also the satyrs, and
sprites, and the maniacs of the valleys, and the witches and goblins and
owls, and destroying demons of the air and firmament, and the demoniac
phantom host and they were inciting and sustaining valour and battle
with them.â€ When the fight was over, they revelled among the bodies of
the slain the heads cut off as barbaric trophies were called â€Machaâ€s
acorn cropâ€. hese grim creations of the savage mind had immense
vitality. While uada, the supreme wargod, vanished early out of the
antheonâ€”killed by the omors in the great battle fought between them
and the godsâ€”adb and the Morrg lived on as late as any of the Gaelic
deities. Indeed, they may be said to still survive in the superstitious
dislike and suspicion shown in all Celticspeaking countries for their
avatar, the hoodiecrow.2

After uada, the greatest of the gods was the agda, whose name seems to
have meant the â€Good Godâ€. he old Irish tract called â€he Choice of
amesâ€ tells us that he was a god of the earth he had a cauldron called
â€he ndryâ€, in which everyone found food in proportion to his merits,
and from which none went away unsatisfied. e also had a living harp as
he played upon it, the seasons came in their orderâ€”spring following
winter, and summer succeeding spring, autumn coming after summer, and,
in its turn, giving place to winter. e is represented as of venerable
aspect and of simple mind and tastes, very fond of porridge, and a
valiant consumer of it. In an ancient tale we have a description of his
dress. e wore a brown, lownecked tunic which only reached down to his
hips, and, over this, a hooded cape which barely covered his shoulders.
n his feet and legs were horsehide boots, the hairy side outwards. e
carried, or, rather, drew after him on a wheel, an eightpronged
warclub, so huge that eight men would have been needed to carry it and
the wheel, as he towed the whole weapon along, made a track like a
territorial boundary. Ancient and grayheaded as he was, and sturdy
porridgeeater, it will be seen from this that he was a formidable
fighter. e did great deeds in the battle between the gods and the
omors, and, on one occasion, is even said to have captured
singlehanded a hundredlegged and fourheaded monster called Mata,
dragged him to the â€tone of ennâ€, near the oyne, and killed him
there.

he agdaâ€s wife was called oann. he was connected in legend with the
iver oyne, to which she gave its name, and, indeed, its very
existence. ormerly there was only a well, shaded by nine magic
hazeltrees. hese trees bore crimson nuts, and it was the property of
the nuts that whoever ate of them immediately became possessed of the
knowledge of everything that was in the world. he story is, in fact, a
Gaelic version of the ebrew myth of â€the ree of the nowledge of Good
and vilâ€. ne class of creatures alone had this privilegeâ€”divine salmon
who lived in the well, and swallowed the nuts as they dropped from the
trees into the water, and thus knew all things, and appear in legend as
the â€almons of nowledgeâ€. All others, even the highest gods, were
forbidden to approach the place. nly oann, with the proverbial womanâ€s
curiosity, dared to disobey this fixed law. he came towards the sacred
well, but, as she did so, its waters rose up at her, and drove her away
before them in a mighty, rushing flood. he escaped but the waters
never returned. hey made the oyne and as for the allknowing
inhabitants of the well, they wandered disconsolately through the depths
of the river, looking in vain for their lost nuts. ne of these salmon
was afterwards eaten by the famous inn mac Coul, upon whom all its
omniscience descended. his way of accounting for the existence of a
river is a favourite one in Irish legend. It is told also of the
hannon, which burst, like the oyne, from an inviolable well, to pursue
another presumptuous nymph called inann, a granddaughter of the seagod
r.

he agda had several children, the most important of whom are rigit,
Angus, Mider, gma, and odb the ed. f these, rigit will be already
familiar to nglish readers who know nothing of Celtic myth. riginally
she was a goddess of fire and the hearth, as well as of poetry, which
the Gaels deemed an immaterial, supersensual form of flame. ut the
early Christianizers of Ireland adopted the pagan goddess into their
roll of saintship, and, thus canonized, she obtained immense popularity
as aint ridget, or ride.

Angus was called Mac c, which means the â€on of the Youngâ€, or,
perhaps, the â€Young Godâ€. his most charming of the creations of the
Celtic mythology is represented as a Gaelic ros, an eternally youthful
exponent of love and beauty. ike his father, he had a harp, but it was
of gold, not oak, as the agdaâ€s was, and so sweet was its music that no
one could hear and not follow it. is kisses became birds which hovered
invisibly over the young men and maidens of rin, whispering thoughts of
love into their ears. e is chiefly connected with the banks of the
oyne, where he had a â€brughâ€, or fairy palace and many stories are
told of his exploits and adventures.

Mider, also the hero of legends, would seem to have been a god of the
underworld, a Gaelic luto. As such, he was connected with the Isle of
algaâ€”a name for what was otherwise, and still is, called the Isle of
Manâ€”where he had a stronghold in which he kept three wonderful cows and
a magic cauldron. e was also the owner of the â€hree Cranes of enial
and Churlishnessâ€, which might be described flippantly as personified
â€gentle hintsâ€. hey stood beside his door, and when anyone approached
to ask for hospitality, the first one said â€o not come do not comeâ€
and the second added â€Get away get awayâ€ while the third chimed in
with â€Go past the house go past the houseâ€0 hese three birds
were, however, stolen from Mider by Aitherne, an avaricious poet, to
whom they would seem to have been more appropriate than to their owner,
who does not otherwise appear as a churlish and illiberal deity. n
the contrary, he is represented as the victim of others, who plundered
him freely. he god Angus took away his wife tain,2 while his cows,
his cauldron, and his beautiful daughter lathnat were carried off as
spoil by the heroes or demigods who surrounded ing Conchobar in the
golden age of lster.

gma, who appears to have been also called Cermait, that is, the
â€honeymouthedâ€, was the god of literature and elouence. e married
tan, the daughter of iancecht, the god of medicine, and had several
children, who play parts more or less prominent in the mythology of the
Gaelic Celts. ne of them was called uirenn, whose three sons murdered
the father of the sungod, and were compelled, as expiation, to pay the
greatest fine ever heard ofâ€”nothing less than the chief treasures of the
world. Another son, Cairpr, became the professional bard of the
uatha  anann, while three others reigned for a short time over the
divine race. As patron of literature, gma was naturally credited with
having been the inventor of the famous gam alphabet. his was an
indigenous script of Ireland, which spread afterwards to Great ritain,
inscriptions in ogmic characters having been found in cotland, the Isle
of Man, outh Wales, evonshire, and at ilchester in ampshire, the
oman city of Calleva Attrebatum. It was originally intended for
inscriptions upon upright pillarstones or upon wands, the euivalents
for letters being notches cut across, or strokes made upon one of the
faces of the angle, the alphabet running as follows

Illustration

When afterwards written in manuscript, the strokes were placed over,
under, or through a horizontal line, in the manner above and the vowels
were represented by short lines instead of notches, as

Illustration

A good example of an ogmic inscription is given in rofessor hysâ€s
ibbert ectures. It comes from a pillar on a small promontory near
unmore ead, in the west of erry, and, read horizontally, reads

Illustration C,       CA CA 
MIIA.

he origin of this alphabet is obscure. ome authorities consider it of
great antiuity, while others believe it entirely postChristian. It
seems, at any rate, to have been based upon, and conseuently to
presuppose a knowledge of, the oman alphabet.

gma, besides being the patron of literature, was the champion, or
professional strong man of the uatha  anann. is epithet is
Grianainech, that is, the â€unnyfacedâ€, from his radiant and shining
countenance.

he last of the agdaâ€s more important children is odb the ed, who
plays a greater part in later than in earlier legend. e succeeded his
father as king of the gods. e is chiefly connected with the south of
Ireland, especially with the Galtee Mountains, and with ough earg,
where he had a famous sdh, or underground palace.

he oseidon of the uatha  anann antheon was called r, but we
hear little of him in comparison with his famous son, Manannn, the
greatest and most popular of his many children. Manannn mac ir was
the special patron of sailors, who invoked him as â€God of eadlandsâ€,
and of merchants, who claimed him as the first of their guild. is
favourite haunts were the Isle of Man, to which he gave his name, and
the Isle of Arran, in the irth of Clyde, where he had a palace called
â€mhain of the Applereesâ€. e had many famous weaponsâ€”two spears
called â€Yellow haftâ€ and â€ed avelinâ€, a sword called â€he
etaliatorâ€, which never failed to slay, as well as two others known as
the â€Great uryâ€ and the â€ittle uryâ€. e had a boat called
â€Wavesweeperâ€, which propelled and guided itself wherever its owner
wished, and a horse called â€plendid Maneâ€, which was swifter than the
spring wind, and travelled eually fast on land or over the waves of the
sea. o weapon could hurt him through his magic mail and breastplate,
and on his helmet there shone two magic ewels bright as the sun. e
endowed the gods with the mantle which made them invisible at will, and
he fed them from his pigs, which, like the boar hrimnir, in the orse
alhalla, renewed themselves as soon as they had been eaten. f these,
no doubt, he made his â€east of Ageâ€, the banuet at which those who ate
never grew old. hus the people of the goddess anu preserved their
immortal youth, while the ale of Goibniu the mithGod bestowed
invulnerability upon them. It is fitting that Manannn himself should
have been blessed beyond all the other gods with inexhaustible life up
to the latest days of Irish heroic literature his luminous figure shines
prominent, nor is it even yet wholly forgotten.

Goibniu, the Gaelic ephaestus, who made the people of the goddess anu
invulnerable with his magic drink, was also the forger of their weapons.
It was he who, helped by uchtain, the divine carpenter, and Credn,
the divine bronzeworker, made the armoury with which the uatha 
anann conuered the omors. ually useful to them was iancecht, the
god of medicine. It was he who once saved Ireland, and was
indirectly the cause of the name of the iver arrow. he Morrg, the
heavengodâ€s fierce wife, had borne a son of such terrible aspect that
the physician of the gods, foreseeing danger, counselled that he should
be destroyed in his infancy. his was done and iancecht opened the
infantâ€s heart, and found within it three serpents, capable, when they
grew to full size, of depopulating Ireland. e lost no time in
destroying these serpents also, and burning them into ashes, to avoid
the evil which even their dead bodies might do. More than this, he flung
the ashes into the nearest river, for he feared that there might be
danger even in them and, indeed, so venomous were they that the river
boiled up and slew every living creature in it, and therefore has been
called â€arrowâ€ boiling ever since.

iancecht had several children, of whom two followed their fatherâ€s
profession. hese were Miach and his sister Airmid. here were also
another daughter, tan, who married Cermait or gma, and three other
sons called Cian, Ceth, and Cu. Cian married thniu, the daughter of
alor the omor, and they had a son who was the crowning glory of the
Gaelic antheonâ€”its Apollo, the unGod,â€”ugh, called
amhfada0, which means the â€onghandedâ€, or the â€arshooterâ€. It
was not, however, with the bow, like the Apollo of the Greeks, but with
the rodsling that ugh performed his feats his worshippers sometimes
saw the terrible weapon in the sky as a rainbow, and the Milky Way was
called â€ughâ€s Chainâ€. e also had a magic spear, which, unlike the
rodsling, he had no need to wield, himself for it was alive, and
thirsted so for blood that only by steeping its head in a
sleepingdraught of pounded poppy leaves could it be kept at rest. When
battle was near, it was drawn out then it roared, and struggled against
its thongs fire flashed from it and, once slipped from the leash, it
tore through and through the ranks of the enemy, never tired of slaying.
Another of his possessions was a magic hound which an ancient poem,
attributed to the enian hero, Caoilte, callsâ€”

            â€hat hound of mightiest deeds,
             Which was irresistible in hardness of combat,
             Was better than wealth ever known,
             A ball of fire every night.

            â€ther virtues had that beautiful hound
             etter this property than any other property,
             Mead or wine would grow of it,
             hould it bathe in spring water.â€

his marvellous hound, as well as the marvellous spear, and the
indestructible pigs of Manannn were obtained for ugh by the sons of
uirenn as part of the bloodfine he exacted from them for the murder of
his father Cian.2 A hardly less curious story is that which tells how
ugh got his name of the Ioldanach, or the â€Master of All Artsâ€.

hese are, of course, only the greater deities of the Gaelic antheon,
their divinities which answered to such ellenic figures as emeter,
eus, er, Cronos, Athena, ros, ades, ermes, ephaestus,
Aesculapius, and Apollo. All of them had many descendants, some of whom
play prominent parts in the heroic cycles of the â€ed ranch of lsterâ€
and of the â€eniansâ€. In addition to these, there must have been a
multitude of lesser gods who stood in much the same relation to the
great gods as the rank and file of tribesmen did to their chiefs. Most
of these were probably local deities of the various clansâ€”the gods their
heroes swore by. ut it is also possible that some may have been
divinities of the aboriginal race. rofessor hys thinks that he can
still trace a few of such Iberian gods by name, as t, i or oi, Corb,
and eth. ut they play no recognizable part in the stories of the
Gaelic gods.

he people of the goddess anu were not the first divine inhabitants of
Ireland. thers had been before them, dwellers in â€the dark backward and
abysm of timeâ€. In this the Celtic mythology resembles those of other
nations, in almost all of which we find an old, dim realm of gods
standing behind the reigning antheon. uch were Cronos and the itans,
dispossessed by the eus who seemed, even to esiod, something of a
parvenu deity. Gaelic tradition recognizes two divine dynasties
anterior to the uatha  anann. he first of these was called â€he
ace of artholonâ€. Its head and leader cameâ€”as all gods and men came,
according to Celtic ideasâ€”from the ther World, and landed in Ireland
with a retinue of twentyfour males and twentyfour females upon the
first of May, the day called â€eltaineâ€, sacred to il, the god of
death. At this remote time, Ireland consisted of only one treeless,
grassless plain, watered by three lakes and nine rivers. ut, as the
race of artholon increased, the land stretched, or widened, under
themâ€”some said miraculously, and others, by the labours of artholonâ€s
people. At any rate, during the three hundred years they dwelt there, it
grew from one plain to four, and acuired seven new lakes which was
fortunate, for the race of artholon increased from fortyeight members
to five thousand, in spite of battles with the omors.

hese would seem to have been inevitable. Whatever gods ruled, they
found themselves in eternal opposition to the notgodsâ€”the powers of
darkness, winter, evil, and death. he race of artholon warred against
them with success. At the lain of Ith, artholon defeated their leader,
a gigantic demon called Cichol the ootless, and dispersed his deformed
and monstrous host. After this there was uiet for three hundred years.
henâ€”upon the same fatal first of Mayâ€”there began a mysterious epidemic,
which lasted a week, and destroyed them all. In premonition of their
end, they foregathered upon the original, firstcreated plainâ€”then
called en Mag, or the â€ld lainâ€,â€”so that those who survived might
the more easily bury those that died. heir funeralplace is still
marked by a mound near ublin, called â€allaghtâ€ in the maps, but
formerly known as amlecht Muintre artholain, the â€laguegrave of
artholonâ€s eopleâ€. his would seem to have been a development of the
very oldest form of the legendâ€”which knew nothing of a plague, but
merely represented the people of artholon as having returned, after
their soourn in Ireland, to the other world, whence they cameâ€”and is
probably due to the gradual euhemerization of the ancient gods into
ancient men.

ollowing the race of artholon, came the race of emed, which carried
on the work and traditions of its forerunner. uring its time, Ireland
again enlarged herself, to the extent of twelve new plains and four more
lakes. ike the people of artholon, the race of emed struggled with
the omors, and defeated them in four consecutive battles. hen emed
died, with two thousand of his people, from an epidemic, and the
remnant, left without their leader, were terribly oppressed by the
omors. wo omorian kingsâ€”Morc, son of ela, and Conann, son of
ebarâ€”had built a tower of glass upon ory Island, always their chief
stronghold, and where stories of them still linger, and from this
vantagepoint they dictated a tax which recalls that paid, in Greek
story, to the Cretan Minotaur. wothirds of the children born to the
race of emed during the year were to be delivered up on each day of
amhain. Goaded by this to a last desperate effort, the survivors of
emedâ€s people attacked the tower, and took it, Conann perishing in the
struggle. ut their triumph was short. Morc, the other king, collected
his forces, and inflicted such a slaughter upon the people of emed
that, out of the sixteen thousand who had assembled for the storming of
the tower, only thirty survived. And these returned whence they came, or
diedâ€”the two acts being, mythologically speaking, the same.

ne cannot help seeing a good deal of similarity between the stories of
these two mythical invasions of Ireland. specially noticeable is the
account of the epidemic which destroyed all artholonâ€s people and
nearly all of emedâ€s. ence it has been held that the two legends are
duplicates, and that there was at first only one, which has been adapted
somewhat differently by two races, the Iberians and the Gaels. rofessor
hys considers the account of emed to have been the original Celtic
one, and the artholon story, the version of it which the native races
made to please themselves. he name â€artholonâ€, with its initial p,
is entirely foreign to the genius of Gaelic speech. Moreover, artholon
himself is given, by the early chroniclers, ancestors whose decidedly
nonAryan names reappear afterwards as the names of ir olg chiefs.
emed was later than artholon in Ireland, as the Gaels, or â€Milesiansâ€,
were later than the Iberians, or â€ir olgsâ€.

hese â€ir olgsâ€ are found in myth as the next colonizers of Ireland.
arying traditions say that they came from Greece, or from â€painâ€â€”which
was a postChristian euphemism for the Celtic ades. hey consisted
of three tribes, called the â€ir omnannâ€ or â€Men of omnuâ€, the â€ir
Gaillionâ€ or â€Men of Gaillionâ€, and the â€ir olgâ€ or â€Men of olgâ€
but, in spite of the fact that the firstnamed tribe was the most
important, they are usually called collectively after the last. Curious
stories are told of their life in Greece, and how they came to Ireland
but these are somewhat factitious, and obviously do not belong to the
earliest tradition.

In the time of their domination they had, we are told, partitioned
Ireland among them the ir olg held lster the ir omnann, divided
into three kingdoms, occupied orth Munster, outh Munster, and
Connaught while the ir Gaillion owned einster. hese five provinces
met at a hill then called â€alorâ€s illâ€, but afterwards the â€ill of
isnechâ€. It is near athconrath, in the county of West Meath, and was
believed, in early times, to mark the exact centre of Ireland. hey held
the country from the departure of the people of emed to the coming of
the people of the goddess anu, and during this period they had nine
supreme kings. At the time of the arrival of the gods, their kingâ€s name
was ochaid son of rc, surnamed â€he roudâ€.

We have practically no other details regarding their life in Ireland. It
is obvious, however, that they were not really gods, but the preAryan
race which the Gaels, when they landed in Ireland, found already in
occupation. here are many instances of peoples at a certain stage of
culture regarding tribes in a somewhat lower one as semidivine, or,
rather, halfdiabolical. he suspicion and fear with which the early
Celts must have regarded the savage aborigines made them seem â€larger
than humanâ€. hey feared them for the weird magical rites which they
practised in their inaccessible forts among the hills, amid storms and
mountain mists. he Gaels, who held themselves to be the children of
light, deemed these â€dark Iberiansâ€ children of the dark. heir tribal
names seem to have been, in several instances, founded upon this idea.
here were the Corcaidce â€eople of arknessâ€ and the
Corcauibhne â€eople of the ightâ€. he territory of the western
tribe of the i orchaide â€ons of arkâ€ was called the â€ight
Countryâ€.00 he Celts, who held their own gods to have preceded them
into Ireland, would not believe that even the uatha  anann could
have wrested the land from these magicskilled Iberians without battle.

hey seem also to have been considered as in some way connected with the
omors. ust as the largest Iberian tribe was called the â€Men of omnuâ€,
so the omors were called the â€Gods of omnuâ€, and Indech, one of their
kings, is a â€son of omnuâ€. hus eternal battle between the gods,
children of anu, and the giants, children of omnu, would reflect, in
the supernatural world, the perpetual warfare between invading Celt and
resisting Iberian. It is shadowed, too, in the later heroic cycle. he
champions of lster, Aryans and Gaels par excellence, have no such
bitter enemies as the ir omnann of Munster and the ir Gaillion of
einster. A few scholars would even see in the later deathstruggle
between the igh ing of Ireland and his rebellious enians the last
historic or mythological adumbration of racial war.0

he enemies alike of ir olg and omor, the uatha  anann, gods of
the Gaels, were the next to arrive. What is probably the earliest
account tells us that they came from the sky. ater versions, however,
give them a habitation upon earthâ€”some say in the north, others in the
â€southern isles of the worldâ€. hey had dwelt in four mythical cities
called indias, Gorias, Murias, and alias, where they had learned
poetry and magicâ€”to the primitive mind two not very dissimilar
thingsâ€”and whence they had brought to Ireland their four chief
treasures. rom indias came uadaâ€s sword, from whose stroke no one
ever escaped or recovered from Gorias, ughâ€s terrible lance from
Murias, the agdaâ€s cauldron and from alias, the tone of l, better
known as the â€tone of estinyâ€, which afterwards fell into the hands of
the early kings of Ireland. According to legend, it had the magic
property of uttering a human cry when touched by the rightful ing of
rin. ome have recognized in this marvellous stone the same rude block
which dward I brought from cone in the year 00, and placed in
Westminster Abbey, where it now forms part of the Coronation Chair. It
is a curious fact that, while cottish legend asserts this stone to have
come to cotland from Ireland, Irish legend should also declare that it
was taken from Ireland to cotland. his would sound like conclusive
evidence, but it is none the less held by leading modern
archologistsâ€”including r. W. . kene, who has published a monograph
on the subect02â€”that the tone of cone and the tone of ara were
never the same. r. etrie identifies the real ia il with a stone
which has always remained in Ireland, and which was removed from its
original position on ara ill, in , to mark the tomb of the rebels
buried close by under a mound now known as â€the Croppiesâ€ graveâ€.0

Whether the uatha  anann came from earth or heaven, they landed in a
dense cloud upon the coast of Ireland on the mystic first of May without
having been opposed, or even noticed by the people whom it will be
convenient to follow the manuscript authorities in calling the â€ir
olgsâ€.0 hat those might still be ignorant of their coming, the
Morrg, helped by adb and Macha, made use of the magic they had
learned in indias, Gorias, Murias, and alias. hey spread
â€druidicallyformed showers and fogsustaining showercloudsâ€ over the
country, and caused the air to pour down fire and blood upon the ir
olgs, so that they were obliged to shelter themselves for three days
and three nights. ut the ir olgs had druids of their own, and, in the
end, they put a stop to these enchantments by counterspells, and the
air grew clear again.

he uatha  anann, advancing westward, had reached a place called the
â€lain of the eaâ€, in einster, when the two armies met. ach sent out
a warrior to parley. he two adversaries approached each other
cautiously, their eyes peeping over the tops of their shields. hen,
coming gradually nearer, they spoke to one another, and the desire to
examine each otherâ€s weapons made them almost friends.

he envoy of the ir olgs looked with wonder at the
â€beautifullyshaped, thin, slender, long, sharppointed spearsâ€ of the
warrior of the uatha  anann, while the ambassador of the tribe of
the goddess anu was not less impressed by the lances of the ir olgs,
which were â€heavy, thick, pointless, but sharplyroundedâ€. hey agreed
to exchange weapons, so that each side might, by an examination of them,
be able to come to some opinion as to its opponentâ€s strength. efore
parting, the envoy of the uatha  anann offered the ir olgs,
through their representative, peace, with a division of the country into
two eual halves.

he ir olg envoy advised his people to accept this offer. ut their
king, ochaid, son of rc, would not. â€If we once give these people
half,â€ he said, â€they will soon have the whole.â€

he people of the goddess anu were, on the other hand, very much
impressed by the sight of the ir olgsâ€ weapons. hey decided to secure
a more advantageous position, and, retreating farther west into
Connaught, to a plain then called ia, but now Moytura, near the present
village of Cong, they drew up their line at its extreme end, in front of
the pass of algatan0, which offered a retreat in case of defeat.

he ir olgs followed them, and encamped on the nearer side of the
plain. hen uada, ing of the uatha  anann, sent an ambassador
offering the same terms as before. Again the ir olgs declined them.

â€hen whenâ€, asked the envoy, â€do you intend to give battleâ€

â€We must have a truce,â€ they said, â€for we want time to repair our
armour, burnish our helmets, and sharpen our swords. esides, we must
have spears like yours made for us, and you must have spears like ours
made for you.â€

he result of this chivalrous, but, to modern ideas, amazing, parley was
that a truce of one hundred and five days was agreed upon.

It was on Midsummer ay that the opposing armies at last met. he people
of the goddess anu appeared in â€a flaming lineâ€, wielding their
â€redbordered, speckled, and firm shieldsâ€. pposite to them were ranged
the ir olgs, â€sparkling, brilliant, and flaming, with their swords,
spears, blades, and trowelspearsâ€. he proceedings began with a kind of
deadly hurleymatch, in which thrice nine of the uatha  anann played
the same number of the ir olgs, and were defeated and killed. hen
followed another parley, to decide how the battle should be carried on,
whether there should be fighting every day or only on every second day.
Moreover, uada obtained from ochaid an assurance that the battles
should always be fought with eual numbers, although this was, we are
told, â€very disagreeable to the ir olg king, because he had largely
the advantage in the numbers of his armyâ€. hen warfare recommenced with
a series of single combats, like those of the Greeks and roans in the
â€Iliadâ€. At the end of each day the conuerors on both sides went back
to their camps, and were refreshed by being bathed in healing baths of
medicinal herbs.

o the fight went on for four days, with terrible slaughter upon each
side. A ir olg champion called reng fought in single combat with
uada, the ing of the Gods, and shore off his hand and half his shield
with one terrific blow. ochaid, the ing of the ir olgs, was even
less fortunate than uada for he lost his life. uffering terribly from
thirst, he went, with a hundred of his men, to look for water, and was
followed, and pursued as far as the strand of allysadare, in ligo.
ere he turned to bay, but was killed, his grave being still marked by a
tumulus. he ir olgs, reduced at last to three hundred men, demanded
single combat until all upon one side were slain. ut, sooner than
consent to this, the uatha  anann offered them a fifth part of
Ireland, whichever province they might choose. hey agreed, and chose
Connaught, ever afterwards their especial home, and where, until the
middle of the seventeenth century, men were still found tracing their
descent from reng.

he whole story has a singularly historical, curiously unmythological
air about it, which contrasts strangely with the account of the other
battle of the same name which the uatha  anann waged afterwards with
the omors. he neighbourhood of Cong still preserves both relics and
traditions of the fight. pon the plain of â€outhern Moyturaâ€ as it is
called, to distinguish it from the â€orthern Moyturaâ€ of the second
battle are many circles and tumuli. hese circles are especially
numerous near the village itself and it is said that there were
formerly others, which have been used for making walls and dykes. arge
cairns of stones, too, are scattered over what was certainly once the
scene of a great battle.0 hese various prehistoric monuments each
have their stilltold story and ir William Wilde, as he relates in his
ough Corrib,0 was so impressed by the unexpected agreement
between the details of the legendary battle, as he read them in the
ancient manuscript, and the traditions still attaching to the mounds,
circles, and cairns, that he tells us he could not help coming to the
conclusion that the account was absolutely historical. Certainly the
coincidences are curious. is opinion was that the â€ir olgsâ€ were a
colony of elg, and that the â€uatha  anannâ€ were anes. ut the
people of the goddess anu are too obviously mythical to make it worth
while to seek any standingground for them in the world of reality. In
their superhuman attributes, they are uite different from the ir
olgs. In the epical cycle it is made as clear that the uatha  anann
are divine beings as it is that the ir olg, the ir omnann, and the
ir Gaillion stand on exactly the same footing as the men of lster.
ater history records by what Milesian kings and on what terms of
rackrent the three tribes were allowed settlements in other parts of
Ireland than their native Connaught. hey appear in ancient, medival,
and almost modern chronicles as the old race of the land. he truth
seems to be that the whole story of the war between the gods and the ir
olgs is an invention of comparatively late times. In the earliest
documents there is only one battle of Moytura, fought between the people
of the goddess anu and the omors. he idea of doubling it seems to
date from after the eleventh century0 and its inventor may very
well have used the legends concerning this battlefield, where two
unknown armies had fought in days gone by, in compiling his story. It
never belonged to the same genuine mythological stratum as the legend of
the original battle fought by the uatha  anann, the gods of the
Gaels, against the omors, the gods of the Iberians.

                       I   G0


It was as a result of the loss of his hand in this battle with the ir
olgs that uada got his name of Argetlm, that is, the â€ilver
andedâ€. or iancecht, the physician of the uatha  anann, made him
an artificial hand of silver, so skilfully that it moved in all its
oints, and was as strong and supple as a real one. ut, good as it was
of its sort, it was a blemish and, according to Celtic custom, no
maimed person could sit upon the throne. uada was deposed and the
uatha  anann went into council to appoint a new king.

hey agreed that it would be a politic thing for them to conciliate the
omors, the giants of the sea, and make an alliance with them. o they
sent a message to ress, the son of the omorian king, lathan, asking
him to come and rule over them. ress accepted this offer and they made
a marriage between him and rigit, the daughter of the agda. At the
same time, Cian0, the son of iancecht, the physician of the uatha
 anann, married thniu, the daughter of the omor, alor. hen ress
was made king, and endowed with lands and a palace and he, on his part,
gave hostages that he would abdicate if his rule ever became unpleasing
to those who had elected him.

ut, in spite of all his fair promises, ress, who belonged in heart to
his own fierce people, began to oppress his subects with excessive
taxes. e put a tax upon every hearth, upon every kneadingtrough, and
upon every uern, as well as a polltax of an ounce of gold upon every
member of the uatha  anann. y a crafty trick, too, he obtained the
milk of all their cattle. e asked at first only for the produce of any
cows which happened to be brown and hairless, and the people of the
goddess anu granted him this cheerfully. ut ress passed all the
cattle in Ireland between two fires, so that their hair was singed off,
and thus obtained the monopoly of the main source of food. o earn a
livelihood, all the gods, even the greatest, were now forced to labour
for him. gma, their champion, was sent out to collect firewood, while
the agda was put to work building forts and castles.

ne day, when the agda was at his task, his son, Angus, came to him.
â€You have nearly finished that castle,â€ he said. â€What reward do you
intend to ask from ress when it is doneâ€ he agda replied that he had
not yet thought of it. â€et me give you some advice,â€ said Angus. â€Ask
ress to have all the cattle in Ireland gathered together upon a plain,
so that you can pick out one for yourself. e will consent to that. hen
choose the blackmaned heifer called â€ceanâ€.â€

he agda finished building the fort, and then went to ress for his
reward. â€What will you haveâ€ asked ress. â€I want all the cattle in
Ireland gathered together upon a plain, so that I may choose one of them
for myself.â€ ress did this and the agda took the blackmaned heifer
Angus had told him of. he king, who had expected to be asked very much
more, laughed at what he thought was the agdaâ€s simplicity. ut Angus
had been wise as will be seen hereafter.

Meanwhile ress was infuriating the people of the goddess anu by adding
avarice to tyranny. It was for kings to be liberal to allcomers, but at
the court of ress no one ever greased his knife with fat, or made his
breath smell of ale. or were there ever any poets or musicians or
ugglers or esters there to give pleasure to the people for ress
would distribute no largess. ext, he cut down the very subsistence of
the gods. o scanty was his allowance of food that they began to grow
weak with famine. gma, through feebleness, could only carry onethird
of the wood needed for fuel so that they suffered from cold as well as
from hunger.

It was at this crisis that two physicians, Miach, the son, and Airmid,
the daughter, of iancecht, the god of medicine, came to the castle
where the dispossessed ing uada lived. uadaâ€s porter, blemished, like
himself for he had lost an eye, was sitting at the gate, and on his
lap was a cat curled up asleep. he porter asked the strangers who they
were. â€We are good doctors,â€ they said. â€If that is so,â€ he replied,
â€perhaps you can give me a new eye.â€ â€Certainly,â€ they said, â€we could
take one of the eyes of that cat, and put it in the place where your
lost eye used to be.â€ â€I should be very pleased if you would do that,â€
answered the porter, o Miach and Airmid removed one of the catâ€s eyes,
and put it in the hollow where the manâ€s eye had been.

he story goes on to say that this was not wholly a benefit to him for
the eye retained its catâ€s nature, and, when the man wished to sleep at
nights, the catâ€s eye was always looking out for mice, while it could
hardly be kept awake during the day. evertheless, he was pleased at the
time, and went and told uada, who commanded that the doctors who had
performed this marvellous cure should be brought to him.

As they came in, they heard the king groaning, for uadaâ€s wrist had
festered where the silver hand oined the arm of flesh. Miach asked
where uadaâ€s own hand was, and they told him that it had been buried
long ago. ut he dug it up, and placed it to uadaâ€s stump he uttered
an incantation over it, saying â€inew to sinew, and nerve to nerve be
oinedâ€ and in three days and nights the hand had renewed itself and
fixed itself to the arm, so that uada was whole again.

When iancecht, Miachâ€s father, heard of this, he was very angry to
think that his son should have excelled him in the art of medicine. e
sent for him, and struck him upon the head with a sword, cutting the
skin, but not wounding the flesh. Miach easily healed this. o iancecht
hit him again, this time to the bone. Again Miach cured himself. he
third time his father smote him, the sword went right through the skull
to the membrane of the brain, but even this wound Miach was able to
leech. At the fourth stroke, however, iancecht cut the brain in two,
and Miach could do nothing for that. e died, and iancecht buried him.
And upon his grave there grew up three hundred and sixtyfive stalks of
grass, each one a cure for any illness of each of the three hundred and
sixtyfive nerves in a manâ€s body. Airmid, Miachâ€s sister, plucked all
these very carefully, and arranged them on her mantle according to their
properties. ut her angry and ealous father overturned the cloak, and
hopelessly confused them. If it had not been for that act, says the
early writer, men would know how to cure every illness, and would so be
immortal.

he healing of uadaâ€s blemish happened ust at the time when all the
people of the goddess anu had at last agreed that the exactions and
tyranny of ress could no longer be borne. It was the insult he put upon
Cairpr, son of gma the god of literature, that caused things to come
to this head. oets were always held by the Celts in great honour and
when Cairpr, the bard of the uatha  anann, went to visit ress, he
expected to be treated with much consideration, and fed at the kingâ€s
own table. ut, instead of doing so, ress lodged him in a small, dark
room where there was no fire, no bed, and no furniture except a mean
table on which small cakes of dry bread were put on a little dish for
his food. he next morning, Cairpr rose early and left the palace
without having spoken to ress. It was the custom of poets when they
left a kingâ€s court to utter a panegyric on their host, but Cairpr
treated ress instead to a magical satire. It was the first satire ever
made in Ireland, and seems to us to bear upon it all the marks of an
early effort. oughly rendered, it said

            â€o meat on the plates,
               o milk of the cows
             o shelter for the belated
               o money for the minstrels
             May ressâ€s cheer be what he gives to othersâ€

his satire of Cairprâ€s was, we are assured, so virulent that it caused
great red blotches to break out all over ressâ€s face. his in itself
constituted a blemish such as should not be upon a king, and the uatha
 anann called upon ress to abdicate and let uada take the throne
again.

ress was obliged to do so. e went back to the country of the omors,
underneath the sea, and complained to his father lathan, its king,
asking him to gather an army to reconuer his throne. he omors
assembled in councilâ€”lathan, ethra, alor, Indech, and all the other
warriors and chiefsâ€”and they decided to come with a great host, and take
Ireland away, and put it under the sea where the people of the goddess
anu would never be able to find it again.

At the same time, another assembly was also being held at ara, the
capital of the uatha  anann. uada was celebrating his return to the
throne by a feast to his people. While it was at its height, a stranger
clothed like a king came to the palace gate. he porter asked him his
name and errand.

â€I am called ugh,â€ he said. â€I am the grandson of iancecht by Cian, my
father, and the grandson of alor by thniu, my mother.â€

â€ut what is your professionâ€ asked the porter â€for no one is admitted
here unless he is a master of some craft.â€

â€I am a carpenter,â€ said ugh.

â€We have no need of a carpenter. We already have a very good one his
name is uchtain.â€

â€I am an excellent smith,â€ said ugh.

â€We do not want a smith. We have a very good one his name is Goibniu.â€

â€I am a professional warrior,â€ said ugh.

â€We have no need of one. gma is our champion.â€

â€I am a harpist,â€ said ugh.

â€We have an excellent harpist already.â€

â€I am a warrior renowned for skilfulness rather than for mere strength.â€

â€We already have a man like that.â€

â€I am a poet and taleteller,â€ said ugh.

â€We have no need of such. We have a most accomplished poet and
taleteller.â€

â€I am a sorcerer,â€ said ugh.

â€We do not want one. We have numberless sorcerers and druids.â€

â€I am a physician,â€ said ugh.

â€iancecht is our physician.â€

â€I am a cupbearer,â€ said ugh.

â€We already have nine of them.â€

â€I am a worker in bronze.â€

â€We have no need of you. We already have a worker in bronze. is name is
Credn.â€

â€hen ask the king,â€ said ugh, â€if he has with him a man who is master
of all these crafts at once, for, if he has, there is no need for me to
come to ara.â€

o the doorkeeper went inside, and told the king that a man had come
who called himself ugh the Ioldanach, or the â€Master of all
Artsâ€, and that he claimed to know everything.

he king sent out his best chessplayer to play against the stranger.
ugh won, inventing a new move called â€ughâ€s enclosureâ€.

hen uada invited him in. ugh entered, and sat down upon the chair
called the â€sageâ€s seatâ€, kept for the wisest man.

gma, the champion, was showing off his strength. pon the floor was a
flagstone so large that fourscore yokes of oxen would have been needed
to move it. gma pushed it before him along the hall, and out at the
door. hen ugh rose from his chair, and pushed it back again. ut this
stone, huge as it was, was only a portion broken from a still greater
rock outside the palace. ugh picked it up, and put it back into its
place.

he uatha  anann asked him to play the harp to them. o he played
the â€sleeptuneâ€, and the king and all his court fell asleep, and did
not wake until the same hour of the following day. ext he played a
plaintive air, and they all wept. astly, he played a measure which sent
them into transports of oy.

When uada had seen all these numerous talents of ugh, he began to
wonder whether one so gifted would not be of great help against the
omors. e took counsel with the others, and, by their advice, lent his
throne to ugh for thirteen days, taking the â€sageâ€s seatâ€ at his side.

ugh summoned all the uatha  anann to a council.

â€he omors are certainly going to make war on us,â€ he said. â€What can
each of you do to helpâ€

iancecht the hysician said â€I will completely cure everyone who is
wounded, provided his head is not cut off, or his brain or spinal marrow
hurt.â€

â€I,â€ said Goibniu the mith, â€will replace every broken lance and sword
with a new one, even though the war last seven years. And I will make
the lances so well that they shall never miss their mark, or fail to
kill. ulb, the smith of the omors, cannot do as much as that. he fate
of the fighting will be decided by my lances.â€

â€And I,â€ said Credn the ronzeworker, â€will furnish all the rivets for
the lances, the hilts for the swords, and the rims and bosses for the
shields.â€

â€And I,â€ said uchtain the Carpenter, â€will provide all the shields and
lanceshafts.â€

gma the Champion promised to kill the ing of the omors, with thrice
nine of his followers, and to capture onethird of his army.

â€And you,  agda,â€ said ugh, â€what will you doâ€

â€I will fight,â€ said the agda, â€both with force and craft. Wherever the
two armies meet, I will crush the bones of the omors with my club, till
they are like hailstones under a horseâ€s feet.â€

â€And you,  Morrgâ€ said ugh.

â€I will pursue them when they flee,â€ she replied. â€And I always catch
what I chase.â€

â€And you,  Cairpr, son of tanâ€ said ugh to the poet, â€what can you
doâ€

â€I will pronounce an immediatelyeffective curse upon them by one of my
satires I will take away all their honour, and, enchanted by me, they
shall not be able to stand against our warriors.â€

â€And ye,  sorcerers, what will ye doâ€

â€We will hurl by our magic arts,â€ replied Mathgan, the head sorcerer,
â€the twelve mountains of Ireland at the omors. hese mountains will be
lieve eague, enna lad, the Mourne Mountains, ri uri, lieve loom,
lieve nechta, lemish, lailiab, ephin, liab Maccu elgodon,
egais2, and Cruachan Aigleâ€.

hen ugh asked the cupbearers what they would do.

â€We will hide away by magic,â€ they said, â€the twelve chief lakes and the
twelve chief rivers of Ireland from the omors, so that they shall not
be able to find any water, however thirsty they may be those waters
will conceal themselves from the omors so that they shall not get a
drop, while they will give drink to the people of the goddess anu as
long as the war lasts, even if it last seven years.â€ And they told ugh
that the twelve chief lakes were ough erg, ough uimnigh, ough
Corrib, ough ee, ough Mask, trangford ough, ough ig, ough
eagh, ough oyle, ough Gara, ough eagh, and Mrloch, and that the
twelve chief rivers were the ush, the oyne, the ann, the em, the
ee, the hannon, the Moy, the ligo, the rne, the inn, the iffey,
and the uir.

inally, the ruid, igol, son of Mamos, said â€I will send three
streams of fire into the faces of the omors, and I will take away
twothirds of their valour and strength, but every breath drawn by the
people of the goddess anu will only make them more valorous and strong,
so that even if the fighting lasts seven years, they will not be weary
of it.â€

All decided to make ready for a war, and to give the direction of it to
ugh.

he preparations for this war are said to have lasted seven years. It
was during the interval that there befel an episode which might almost
be called the â€Argonauticaâ€ of the Gaelic mythology.

In spite of the dethronement of ress, the omors still claimed their
annual tribute from the tribe of the goddess anu, and sent their
taxgatherers, nine times nine in number, to â€alorâ€s illâ€ to collect
it. ut, while they waited for the gods to come to tender their
submission and their subsidy, they saw a young man approaching them. e
was riding upon â€plendid Maneâ€, the horse of Manannn son of r, and
was dressed in Manannnâ€s breastplate and helmet, through which no
weapon could wound their wearer, and he was armed with sword and shield
and poisoned darts. â€ike to the setting sunâ€, says the story, â€was the
splendour of his countenance and his forehead, and they were not able to
look in his face for the greatness of his splendour.â€ And no wonder for
he was ugh the arshooter, the newcome sungod of the Gaels. e fell
upon the omorian taxgatherers, killing all but nine of them, and these
he only spared that they might go back to their kinsmen and tell how the
gods had received them.

here was consternation in the undersea country. â€Who can this terrible
warrior beâ€ asked alor. â€I know,â€ said alorâ€s wife â€he must be the
son of our daughter thniu and I foretell that, since he has cast in
his lot with his fatherâ€s people, we shall never bear rule in rin
again.â€

he chiefs of the omors saw that this slaughter of their taxgatherers
signified that the uatha  anann meant fighting. hey held a council
to debate on it. here came to it lathan and ethra and Indech, kings
of the omors ress himself, and alor of the stout blows Cethlenn the
crooked tooth, alorâ€s wife alorâ€s twelve whitemouthed sons and all
the chief omorian warriors and druids.

Meanwhile, upon earth, ugh was sending messengers all over rin to
assemble the uatha  anann. pon this errand went ughâ€s father Cian,
who seems to have been a kind of lesser solar deity, son of
iancecht, the god of medicine. As Cian was going over the plain of
Muirthemne, he saw three armed warriors approaching him, and, when
they got nearer, he recognized them as the three sons of uirenn, son of
gma, whose names were rian, Iuchar, and Iucharba. etween these three
and Cian, with his brothers Ceth and Cu, there was, for some reason, a
private enmity. Cian saw that he was now at a disadvantage. â€If my
brothers were with me,â€ he said to himself, â€what a fight we would make
but, as I am alone, it will be best for me to conceal myself.â€ ooking
round, he saw a herd of pigs feeding on the plain. ike all the gods, he
had the faculty of shapeshifting so, striking himself with a magic
wand, he changed himself into a pig, oined the herd, and began feeding
with them.

ut he had been seen by the sons of uirenn. â€What has become of the
warrior who was walking on the plain a moment agoâ€ said rian to his
brothers. â€We saw him then,â€ they replied, â€but we do not know where he
is now.â€ â€hen you have not used the proper vigilance which is needed in
time of war,â€ said the elder brother. â€owever, I know what has become
of him. e has struck himself with a druidical wand, and changed himself
into a pig, and there he is, in that herd, rooting up the ground, ust
like all the other pigs. I can also tell you who he is. is name is
Cian, and you know that he is no friend of ours.â€

â€It is a pity that he has taken refuge among the pigs,â€ they replied,
â€for they belong to some one of the uatha  anann, and, even if we
were to kill them all, Cian might still escape us.â€

Again rian reproached his brothers. â€You are very ignorant,â€ he said,
â€if you cannot distinguish a magical beast from a natural beast.
owever, I will show you.â€ And thereupon he struck his two brothers with
his own wand of shapechanging, and turned them into two swift, slender
hounds, and set them upon the pigs.

he magic hounds soon found the magic pig, and drove it out of the herd
on to the open plain. hen rian threw his spear, and hit it. he
wounded pig came to a stop. â€It was an evil deed of yours, casting that
spear,â€ it cried, in a human voice, â€for I am not a pig, but Cian, son
of iancecht. o give me uarter.â€

Iuchar and Iucharba would have granted it, and let him go but their
fiercer brother swore that Cian should be put an end to, even if he came
back to life seven times. o Cian tried a fresh ruse. â€Give me leaveâ€,
he asked, â€only to return to my own shape before you slay me.â€ â€Gladly,â€
replied rian, â€for I would much rather kill a man than a pig.â€

o Cian spoke the befitting spell, cast off his pigâ€s disguise, and
stood before them in his own shape. â€You will be obliged to spare my
life now,â€ he said. â€We will not,â€ replied rian. â€hen it will be the
worst dayâ€s work for all of you that you ever did in your lives,â€ he
answered â€for, if you had killed me in the shape of a pig, you would
only have had to pay the value of a pig, but if you kill me now, I tell
you that there never has been, and there never will be, anyone killed in
this world for whose death a greater bloodfine will be exacted than for
mine.â€

ut the sons of uirenn would not listen to him. hey slew him, and
pounded his body with stones until it was a crushed mass. ix times they
tried to bury him, and the earth cast him back in horror but, the
seventh time, the mould held him, and they put stones upon him to keep
him down. hey left him buried there, and went to ara.

Meanwhile ugh had been expecting his fatherâ€s return. As he did not
come, he determined to go and look for him. e traced him to the lain
of Muirthemne, and there he was at fault. ut the indignant earth
itself, which had witnessed the murder, spoke to ugh, and told him
everything. o ugh dug up his fatherâ€s corpse, and made certain how he
had come to his death then he mourned over him, and laid him back in
the earth, and heaped a barrow over him, and set up a pillar with his
name on it in â€ogamâ€.

e went back to ara, and entered the great hall. It was filled with the
people of the goddess anu, and among them ugh saw the three sons of
uirenn. o he shook the â€chiefsâ€ chainâ€, with which the Gaels used to
ask for a hearing in an assembly, and when all were silent, he said

â€eople of the goddess anu, I ask you a uestion. What would be the
vengeance that any of you would take upon one who had murdered his
fatherâ€

A great astonishment fell upon them, and uada, their king, said
â€urely it is not your father that has been murderedâ€

â€It is,â€ replied ugh. â€And I am looking at those who murdered him and
they know how they did it better than I do.â€

hen uada declared that nothing short of hewing the murderer of his
father limb from limb would satisfy him, and all the others said the
same, including the sons of uirenn.

â€he very ones who did the deed say that,â€ cried ugh. â€hen let them
not leave the hall till they have settled with me about the bloodfine
to be paid for it.â€

â€If it was I who had killed your father,â€ said the king, â€I should think
myself lucky if you were willing to accept a fine instead of vengeance.â€

he sons of uirenn took counsel together in whispers. Iuchar and
Iucharba were in favour of admitting their guilt, but rian was afraid
that, if they confessed, ugh would withdraw his offer to accept a fine,
and would demand their deaths. o he stood out, and said that, though it
was not they who had killed Cian, yet, sooner than remain under ughâ€s
anger, as he suspected them, they would pay the same fine as if they
had.

â€Certainly you shall pay the fine,â€ said ugh, â€and I will tell you what
it shall be. It is this three apples and a pigâ€sskin and a spear
and two horses and a chariot and seven pigs and a houndwhelp and a
cookingspit and three shouts on a hill that is the fine, and, if you
think it is too much, I will remit some of it, but, if you do not think
it is too much, then pay it.â€

â€If it were a hundred times that,â€ replied rian, â€we should not think
it too much. Indeed, it seems so little that I fear there must be some
treachery concealed in it.â€

â€I do not think it too little,â€ replied ugh. â€Give me your pledge
before the people of the goddess anu that you will pay it faithfully,
and I will give you mine that I will ask no more.â€

o the sons of uirenn bound themselves before the uatha  anann to
pay the fine to ugh.

When they had sworn, and given sureties, ugh turned to them again. â€I
will nowâ€, he said, â€explain to you the nature of the fine you have
pledged yourselves to pay me, so that you may know whether it is too
little or not.â€ And, with foreboding hearts, the sons of uirenn set
themselves to listen.

â€he three apples that I have demanded,â€ he began, â€are three apples
from the Garden of the esperides, in the east of the world. You will
know them by three signs. hey are the size of the head of a monthold
child, they are of the colour of burnished gold, and they taste of
honey. Wounds are healed and diseases cured by eating them, and they do
not diminish in any way by being eaten. Whoever casts one of them hits
anything he wishes, and then it comes back into his hand. I will accept
no other apples instead of these. heir owners keep them perpetually
guarded because of a prophecy that three young warriors from the west of
the world will come to take them by force, and, brave as you may be, I
do not think that you will ever get them.

â€he pigâ€sskin that I have demanded is the pigâ€sskin of uis, ing of
Greece. It has two virtues its touch perfectly cures all wounded or
sick persons if only there is any life still left in them and every
stream of water through which it passes is turned into wine for nine
days. I do not think that you will get it from the ing of Greece,
either with his consent or without it.

â€And can you guess what spear it is that I have demandedâ€ asked ugh.
â€We cannot,â€ they said. â€It is the poisoned spear of isear, ing
of ersia it is irresistible in battle it is so fiery that its blade
must always be held under water, lest it destroy the city in which it is
kept. You will find it very difficult to obtain.

â€And the two horses and the chariot are the two wonderful horses of
obhar20, ing of icily, which run eually well over land and sea
there are no other horses in the world like them, and no other vehicle
eual to the chariot.

â€And the seven pigs are the pigs of asal2, ing of the Golden
illars though they may be killed every night, they are found alive
again the next day, and every person that eats part of them can never be
afflicted with any disease.

â€And the houndwhelp I claim is the houndwhelp of the ing of
Ioruaidhe22 her name is ailinis every wild beast she sees she
catches at once. It will not be easy for you to secure her.

â€he cookingspit which you must get for me is one of the cookingspits
of the women of the Island of ianchuiv2, which is at the bottom of
the sea, between rin and Alba.

â€You have also pledged yourselves to give three shouts upon a hill. he
hill upon which they must be given is the hill called Cnoc
Miodhchaoin2, in the north of ochlann2. Miodhchaoin and his
sons do not allow shouts to be given on that hill besides this, it was
they who gave my father his military education, and, even if I were to
forgive you, they would not so that, though you achieve all the other
adventures, I think that you will fail in this one.

â€ow you know what sort of a fine it is that you have bargained to pay
me,â€ said ugh.

And fear and astonishment fell upon the sons of uirenn.

his tale is evidently the work of some ancient Irish storyteller who
wished to compile from various sources a more or less complete account
of how the Gaelic gods obtained their legendary possessions. he spear
of isear, ing of ersia, is obviously the same weapon as the lance of
ugh, which another tradition describes as having been brought by the
uatha  anann from their original home in the city of Gorias2
ailinis, the whelp of the ing of Ioruaidhe, is ughâ€s â€hound of
mightiest deedsâ€, which was irresistible in battle, and which turned any
running water it bathed in into wine,2 a property here transferred
to the magic pigâ€sskin of ing uis the seven swine of the ing of the
Golden illars must be the same undying porkers from whose flesh
Manannn mac ir made the â€east of Ageâ€ which preserved the eternal
youth of the gods2 it was with horses and chariot that ran along
the surface of the sea that Manannn used to ourney to and fro between
rin and the Celtic lysium in the West2 the apples that grew in
the Garden of the esperides were surely of the same celestial growth as
those that fed the inhabitants of that immortal country0 while the
cookingspit reminds us of three such implements at ara, made by
Goibniu and associated with the names of the agda and the Morrg.

he burden of collecting all these treasures was placed upon the
shoulders of the three sons of uirenn.

hey consulted together, and agreed that they could never hope to
succeed unless they had Manannnâ€s magic horse, â€plendid Maneâ€, and
Manannnâ€s magic coracle, â€Wavesweeperâ€. ut both these had been lent
by Manannn to ugh himself. o the sons of uirenn were obliged to
humble themselves to beg them from ugh. he sungod would not lend them
the horse, for fear of making their task too easy, but he let them have
the boat, because he knew how much the spear of isear and the horses of
obhar would be needed in the coming war with the omors. hey bade
farewell to their father, and went down to the shore and put out to sea,
taking their sister with them.

â€Which portion of the fine shall we seek firstâ€ said the others to
rian. â€We will seek them in the order in which they were demanded,â€ he
replied. o they directed the magic boat to sail to the Garden of the
esperides, and presently they arrived there.

hey landed at a harbour, and held a council of war. It was decided that
their best chance of obtaining three of the apples would be by taking
the shapes of hawks. hus they would have strength enough in their claws
to carry the apples away, together with sufficient uickness upon the
wing to hope to escape the arrows, darts, and slingstones which would
be shot and hurled at them by the warders of the garden.

hey swooped down upon the orchard from above. It was done so swiftly
that they carried off the three apples, unhit either by shaft or stone.
ut their difficulties were not yet over. he king of the country had
three daughters who were well skilled in witchcraft. y sorcery they
changed themselves into three ospreys, and pursued the three hawks. ut
the sons of uirenn reached the shore first, and, changing themselves
into swans, dived into the sea. hey came up close to their coracle, and
got into it, and sailed swiftly away with the spoil.

hus their first uest was finished, and they voyaged on to Greece, to
seek the pigâ€sskin of ing uis. o one could go without some excuse
into a kingâ€s court, so they decided to disguise themselves as poets,
and to tell the doorkeeper that they were professional bards from rin,
seeking largess at the hands of kings. he porter let them into the
great hall, where the poets of Greece were singing before the king.

When those had all finished, rian rose, and asked permission to show
his art. his was accorded and he sang

             â€ uis, we conceal not thy fame.
              We praise thee as the oak above the kings
              he skin of a pig, bounty without hardness
              his is the reward which I ask for it.

             â€A stormy host and raging sea
              Are a dangerous power, should one oppose it.
              he skin of a pig, bounty without hardness
              his is the reward I ask,  uis.â€

â€hat is a good poem,â€ said the king, â€only I do not understand it.â€

â€I will explain it,â€ said rian. â€â€We praise thee as the oak above the
kingsâ€ this means that, as the oak excels all other trees, so do you
excel all other kings in nobility and generosity. â€he skin of a pig,
bounty without hardnessâ€ that is a pigâ€sskin which you have,  uis,
and which I should like to receive as the reward of my poem. â€A stormy
host and raging sea are a dangerous power, should one oppose itâ€ this
means to say, that we are not used to going without anything on which we
have set our hearts,  uis.â€

â€I should have liked your poem better,â€ replied the king, â€if my
pigâ€sskin had not been mentioned in it. It was not a wise thing for you
to have done,  poet. ut I will measure three fills of red gold out of
the skin, and you shall have those.â€

â€May all good be thine,  ingâ€ answered rian. â€I knew that I should
get a noble reward.â€

o the king sent for the pigâ€sskin to measure out the gold with. ut,
as soon as rian saw it, he seized it with his left hand, and slew the
man who was holding it, and Iuchar and Iucharba also hacked about them
and they cut their way down to the boat, leaving the ing of Greece
among the dead behind them.

â€And now we will go and get ing isearâ€s spear,â€ said rian. o,
leaving Greece, they sailed in their coracle to ersia.

heir plan of disguising themselves as poets had served them so well
that they decided to make use of it again. o they went into the ing of
ersiaâ€s hall in the same way as they had entered that of the ing of
Greece. rian first listened to the poets of ersia singing then he
sang his own song

              â€mall the esteem of any spear with isear
               he battles of foes are broken
               o oppression to isear
               veryone whom he wounds.

              â€A yewtree, the finest of the wood,
               It is called ing without opposition.
               May that splendid shaft drive on
               Yon crowd into their wounds of death.â€

â€hat is a good poem,  man of rin,â€ said the king, â€but why is my
spear mentioned in itâ€

â€he meaning is this,â€ replied rian â€I should like to receive that
spear as a reward for my poem.â€

â€You make a rash reuest,â€ said the king. â€If I spare your life after
having heard it, it will be a sufficient reward for your poem.â€

rian had one of the magic apples in his hand, and he remembered its
boomeranglike uality. e hurled it full in the ing of ersiaâ€s face,
dashing out his brains. he ersians flew to arms, but the three sons of
uirenn conuered them, and made them yield up the spear.

hey had now to travel to icily, to obtain the horses and chariot of
ing obhar. ut they were afraid to go as poets this time, for fear the
fame of their deeds might have got abroad. hey therefore decided to
pretend to be mercenary soldiers from rin, and offer the ing of icily
their service. his, they thought, would be the easiest way of finding
out where the horses and the chariot were kept. o they went and stood
on the green before the royal court.

When the ing of icily heard that there had come mercenaries from rin,
seeking wages from the kings of the world, he invited them to take
service with him. hey agreed but, though they stayed with him a
fortnight and a month, they never saw the horses, or even found out
where they were kept. o they went to the king, and announced that they
wished to leave him.

â€Whyâ€ he asked, for he did not want them to go.

â€We will tell you,  ingâ€ replied rian. â€It is because we have not
been honoured with your confidence, as we have been accustomed with
other kings. You have two horses and a chariot, the best in the world,
and we have not even been allowed to see them.â€

â€I would have shown them to you on the first day if you had asked me,â€
said the king â€and you shall see them at once, for I have seldom had
warriors with me so good as you are, and I do not wish you to leave me.â€

o he sent for the steeds, and had them yoked to the chariot, and the
sons of uirenn were witnesses of their marvellous speed, and how they
could run eually well over land or water.

rian made a sign to his brothers, and they watched their opportunity
carefully, and, as the chariot passed close beside them, rian leaped
into it, hurling its driver over the side. hen, turning the horses, he
struck ing obhar with isearâ€s spear, and killed him. e took his two
brothers up into the chariot and they drove away.

y the time the sons of uirenn reached the country of asal, ing of
the illars of Gold, rumour had gone before them. he king came down to
the harbour to meet them, and asked them if it were really true that so
many kings had fallen at their hands. hey replied that it was true, but
that they had no uarrel with any of them only they must obtain at all
costs the fine demanded by ugh. hen asal asked them why they had come
to his land, and they told him that they needed his seven pigs to add to
the tribute. o asal thought it better to give them up, and to make
friends with the three sons of uirenn, than to fight with such
warriors. he sons of uirenn were very glad at this, for they were
growing weary of battles.

It happened that the ing of Ioruaidhe, who had the houndwhelp that
ugh had demanded, was the husband of ing asalâ€s daughter. herefore
ing asal did not wish that there should be fighting between him and
the three sons of uirenn. e proposed to rian and his brothers that he
should sail with them to Ioruaidhe, and try to persuade the king of the
country to give up the houndwhelp peacefully. hey consented, and all
set foot safely on the â€delightful, wonderful shores of Ioruaidheâ€,2
as the manuscript calls them. ut ing asalâ€s soninlaw would not
listen to reason. e assembled his warriors, and fought but the sons of
uirenn defeated them, and compelled their king to yield up the
houndwhelp as the ransom for his life.

All these uests had been upon the earth, but the next was harder. o
coracle, not even Manannnâ€s â€Wavesweeperâ€, could penetrate to the
Island of ianchuiv, in the depths of the sea that severs rin from
Alba. o rian left his brothers, and put on his â€waterdress, with his
transparency of glass upon his headâ€â€”evidently an ancient Irish
anticipation of the modern diverâ€s dress. hus euipped, he explored the
bottom of the sea for fourteen days before he found the island. ut when
at last he reached it, and entered the hall of its ueen, she and her
seamaidens were so amazed at rianâ€s hardihood in having penetrated to
their kingdom that they presented him with the cookingspit, and sent
him back safe.

y this time, ugh had found out by his magic arts that the sons of
uirenn had obtained all the treasures he had demanded as the
bloodfine. e desired to get them safely into his own custody before
his victims went to give their three shouts upon Miodhchaoinâ€s ill. e
therefore wove a druidical spell round them, so that they forgot the
rest of their task altogether, and sailed back to rin. hey searched
for ugh, to give him the things, but he had gone away, leaving word
that they were to be handed over to uada, the uatha  anann king. As
soon as they were in safekeeping, ugh came back to ara and found the
sons of uirenn there. And he said to them

â€o you not know that it is unlawful to keep back any part of a
bloodfine o have you given those three shouts upon Miodhchaoinâ€s
illâ€

hen the magic mist of forgetfulness fell from them, and they
remembered. orrowfully they went back to complete their task.

Miodhchaoin himself was watching for them, and, when he saw them
land, he came down to the beach. rian attacked him, and they fought
with the swiftness of two bears and the ferocity of two lions until
Miodhchaoin fell.

hen Miodhchaoinâ€s three sonsâ€”Corc, Conn, and Aedhâ€”came out to avenge
their father, and they drove their spears through the bodies of the
three sons of uirenn. ut the three sons of uirenn also drove their
spears through the bodies of the three sons of Miodhchaoin.

he three sons of Miodhchaoin were killed, and the three sons of uirenn
were so sorely wounded that birds might have flown through their bodies
from one side to the other. evertheless rian was still able to stand
upright, and he held his two brothers, one in each hand, and kept them
on their feet, and, all together, they gave three faint, feeble shouts.

heir coracle bore them, still living, to rin. hey sent their father
uirenn as a suppliant to ugh, begging him to lend them the magic
pigâ€sskin to heal their wounds.

ut ugh would not, for he had counted upon their fight with the sons of
Miodhchaoin to avenge his father Cianâ€s death. o the children of
uirenn resigned themselves to die, and their father made a farewell
song over them and over himself, and died with them.

hus ends that famous taleâ€”â€he ate of the ons of uirennâ€, known as
one of the â€hree orrowful tories of rinâ€.

                               CA I

                       WA WI  GIA


y this time the seven years of preparation had come to an end. A week
before the ay of amhain, the Morrg discovered that the omors had
landed upon rin. he at once sent a messenger to tell the agda, who
ordered his druids and sorcerers to go to the ford of the iver nius,
in ligo, and utter incantations against them.

he people of the goddess anu, however, were not yet uite ready for
battle. o the agda decided to visit the omorian camp as an
ambassador, and, by parleying with them, to gain a little more time. he
omors received him with apparent courtesy, and, to celebrate his
coming, prepared him a feast of porridge for it was wellknown how fond
he was of such food. hey poured into their kingâ€s cauldron, which was
as deep as five giantâ€s fists, fourscore gallons of new milk, with meal
and bacon in proportion. o this they added the whole carcasses of
goats, sheep, and pigs they boiled the mixture together, and poured it
into a hole in the ground. â€ow,â€ said they, â€if you do not eat it all,
we shall put you to death, for we will not have you go back to your own
people and say that the omors are inhospitable.â€ ut they did not
succeed in frightening the agda. e took his spoon, which was so large
that two persons of our puny size might have reclined comfortably in the
middle of it, dipped it into the porridge, and fished up halves of
salted pork and uarters of bacon.

â€If it tastes as good as it smells,â€ he said, â€it is good fare.â€ And so
it proved for he ate it all, and scraped up even what remained at the
bottom of the hole. hen he went away to sleep it off, followed by the
laughter of the omors for his stomach was so swollen with food that he
could hardly walk. It was larger than the biggest cauldron in a large
house, and stood out like a sail before the wind.

ut the omorsâ€ little practical oke upon the agda had given the
uatha  anann time to collect their forces. It was on the eve of
amhain that the two armies came face to face. ven then the omors
could not believe that the people of the goddess anu would offer them
much resistance.

â€o you think they will really dare to give us battleâ€ said ress to
Indech, the son of omnu. â€If they do not pay their tribute, we will
pound their bones for them,â€ he replied.

he war of gods and giants naturally mirrored the warfare of the Gaels,
in whose battles, as in those of most semibarbarous people, single
combat figured largely. he main armies stood still, while, every day,
duels took place between ambitious combatants. ut no great warriors
either of the uatha  anann or of the omors took part in them.

ometimes a god, sometimes a giant would be the victor but there was a
difference in the net results that astonished the omors. If their own
swords and lances were broken, they were of no more use, and if their
own champions were killed, they never came back to life again but it
was uite otherwise with the people of the goddess anu. Weapons
shattered on one day reappeared upon the next in as good condition as
though they had never been used, and warriors slain on one day came back
upon the morrow unhurt, and ready, if necessary, to be killed again.

he omors decided to send someone to discover the secret of these
prodigies. he spy they chose was uadan, the son of ress and of
rigit, daughter of the agda, and therefore halfgiant and halfgod. e
disguised himself as a uatha  anann warrior, and went to look for
Goibniu. e found him at his forge, together with uchtain, the
carpenter, and Credn, the bronzeworker. e saw how Goibniu forged
lanceheads with three blows of his hammer, while uchtain cut shafts
for them with three blows of his axe, and Credn fixed the two parts
together so adroitly that his bronze nails needed no hammering in. e
went back and told the omors, who sent him again, this time to try and
kill Goibniu.

e reappeared at the forge, and asked for a avelin. Without suspicion,
Goibniu gave him one, and, as soon as he got it into his hand, he thrust
it through the smithâ€s body. ut Goibniu plucked it out, and, hurling it
back at his assailant, mortally wounded him. uadan went home to die,
and his father ress and his mother rigit mourned for him, inventing
for the purpose the Irish â€keeningâ€. Goibniu, on the other hand, took no
harm. e went to the physician iancecht, who, with his daughter Airmid,
was always on duty at a miraculous well called the â€spring of healthâ€.
Whenever one of the uatha  anann was killed or wounded, he was
brought to the two doctors, who plunged him into the wonderworking
water, and brought him back to life and health again.

he mystic spring was not long, however, allowed to help the people of
the goddess. A young omorian chief, ctriallach son of Indech, found it
out. e and a number of his companions went to it by night, each
carrying a large stone from the bed of the iver rowes. hese they
dropped into the spring, until they had filled it, dispersed the healing
water, and formed a cairn above it. egend has identified this place by
the name of the â€Cairn of ctriallachâ€.

his success determined the omors to fight a pitched battle. hey drew
out their army in line. here was not a warrior in it who had not a coat
of mail and a helmet, a stout spear, a strong buckler, and a heavy
sword. â€ighting the omors on that dayâ€, says the old author, â€could
only be compared to one of three thingsâ€”beating oneâ€s head against a
rock, or plunging it into a fire, or putting oneâ€s hand into a serpentâ€s
nest.â€

All the great fighters of the uatha  anann were drawn out opposite
to them, except ugh. A council of the gods had decided that his varied
accomplishments made his life too valuable to be risked in battle. hey
had, therefore, left him behind, guarded by nine warriors. ut, at the
last moment, ugh escaped from his warders, and appeared in his chariot
before the army. e made them a patriotic speech. â€ight bravely,â€ he
said, â€that your servitude may last no longer it is better to face
death than to live in vassalage and pay tribute.â€ With these encouraging
words, he drove round the ranks, standing on tiptoe, so that all the
uatha  anann might see him.

he omors saw him too, and marvelled. â€It seems wonderful to me,â€
said ress to his druids, â€that the sun should rise in the west today
and in the east every other day.â€ â€It would be better for us if it were
so,â€ replied the druids. â€What else can it be, thenâ€ asked ress. â€It
is the radiance of the face of ugh of the ong Arms,â€ said they.

hen the two armies charged each other with a great shout. pears and
lances smote against shields, and so great was the shouting of the
fighters, the shattering of shields, the clattering of swords, the
rattling of uivers, and the whistling of darts and avelins that it
seemed as if thunder rolled everywhere.

hey fought so closely that the heads, hands, and feet of those on one
side were touching the heads, hands, and feet of those on the other
side they shed so much blood on to the ground that it became hard to
stand on it without slipping and the river of nsenn was filled with
dead bodies, so hard and swift and bloody and cruel was the battle.

Many great chiefs fell on each side. gma, the champion of the uatha 
anann, killed Indech, the son of the goddess omnu. ut, meanwhile,
alor of the Mighty lows raged among the gods, slaying their king,
uada of the ilver and, as well as Macha, one of his warlike wives. At
last he met with ugh. he sungod shouted a challenge to his
grandfather in the omorian speech. alor heard it, and prepared to use
his deathdealing eye.

â€ift up my eyelid,â€ he said to his henchmen, â€that I may see this
chatterer who talks to me.â€

he attendants lifted alorâ€s eye with a hook, and if the glance of the
eye beneath had rested upon ugh, he would certainly have perished. ut,
when it was half opened, ugh flung a magic stone which struck alorâ€s
eye out through the back of his head. he eye fell on the ground behind
alor, and destroyed a whole rank of thrice nine omors who were unlucky
enough to be within sight of it.

An ancient poem has handed down the secret of this magic stone. It is
there called a tathlum, meaning a â€concrete ballâ€ such as the ancient
Irish warriors used sometimes to make out of the brains of dead enemies
hardened with lime.

             â€A tathlum, heavy, fiery, firm,
              Which the uatha  anann had with them,
              It was that broke the fierce alorâ€s eye,
              f old, in the battle of the great armies.

             â€he blood of toads and furious bears,
              And the blood of the noble lion,
              he blood of vipers and of smuinnâ€s trunksâ€”
              It was of these the tathlum was composed.

             â€he sand of the swift Armorian sea,
              And the sand of the teeming ed eaâ€”
              All these, being first purified, were used
              In the composition of the tathlum.

             â€riun, the son of ethar, no mean warrior,
              Who on the oceanâ€s eastern border reignedâ€”
              It was he that fused, and smoothly formed,
              It was he that fashioned the tathlum.

             â€o the hero ugh was given
              his concrete ball,â€”no soft missileâ€”
              In Mag uireadh of shrieking wails,
              rom his hand he threw the tathlum.â€

his blinding of the terrible alor turned the fortunes of the fight
for the omors wavered, and the Morrg came and encouraged the people
of the goddess anu with a song, beginning â€ings arise to the battleâ€,
so that they took fresh heart, and drove the omors headlong back to
their country underneath the sea.

uch was the battle which is called in Irish Mag uireadh na
bomorach, that is to say, the â€lain of the owers of the omorsâ€,
and, more popularly, the â€attle of Moytura the orthernâ€, to
distinguish it from the other attle of Moytura fought by the uatha 
anann against the ir olgs farther to the south. More of the omors
were killed in it, says the ancient manuscript, than there are stars in
the sky, grains of sand on the seashore, snowflakes in winter, drops
of dew upon the meadows in springtime, hailstones during a storm,
blades of grass trodden under horsesâ€ feet, or Manannn son of râ€s
white horses, the waves of the sea, when a tempest breaks. he â€towersâ€
or pillars said to mark the graves of the combatants still stand upon
the plain of Carrowmore, near ligo, and form, in the opinion of r.
etrie, the finest collection of prehistoric monuments in the world,
with the sole exception of Carnac, in rittany. Megalithic
structures of almost every kind are found among themâ€”stone cairns with
dolmens in their interiors, dolmens standing open and alone, dolmens
surrounded by one, two, or three circles of stones, and circles without
dolmensâ€”to the number of over a hundred. ixtyfour of such prehistoric
remains stand together upon an elevated plateau not more than a mile
across, and make the battlefield of Moytura, though the least known,
perhaps the most impressive of all primeval ruins. What they really
commemorated we may never know, but, in all probability, the place was
the scene of some important and decisive early battle, the monuments
marking the graves of the chieftains who were interred as the result of
it. hose which have been examined were found to contain burnt wood and
the halfburnt bones of men and horses, as well as implements of flint
and bone. he actors, therefore, were still in the eolithic Age.
Whether the horses were domesticated ones buried with their riders, or
wild ones eaten at the funeral feasts, it would be hard to decide. he
history of the real event must have been long lost even at the early
date when its relics were pointed out as the records of a battle between
the gods and the giants of Gaelic myth.

he uatha  anann, following the routed omors, overtook and captured
ress. e begged ugh to spare his life.

â€What ransom will you pay for itâ€ asked ugh.

â€I will guarantee that the cows of Ireland shall always be in milk,â€
promised ress.

ut, before accepting, ugh took counsel with his druids.

â€What good will that be,â€ they decided, â€if ress does not also lengthen
the lives of the cowsâ€

his was beyond the power of ress to do so he made another offer.

â€ell your people,â€ he said to ugh, â€that, if they will spare my life,
they shall have a good wheat harvest every year.â€

ut they said â€We already have the spring to plough and sow in, the
summer to ripen the crops, the autumn for reaping, and the winter in
which to eat the bread and that is all we want.â€

ugh told this to ress. ut he also said â€You shall have your life in
return for a much less service to us than that.â€

â€What is itâ€ asked ress.

â€ell us when we ought to plough, when we ought to sow, and when we
ought to harvest.â€

ress replied â€You should plough on a uesday, sow on a uesday, and
harvest on a uesday.â€

And this lying maxim says the story saved ressâ€s life.

ugh, the agda, and gma still pursued the omors, who had carried off
in their flight the agdaâ€s harp. hey followed them into the submarine
palace where ress and lathan lived, and there they saw the harp
hanging on the wall. his harp of the agdaâ€s would not play without its
ownerâ€s leave. he agda sang to it

              â€Come, oak of the two cries
               Come, hand of fourfold music
               Come, summer Come, winter
               oice of harps, bellows, and flutesâ€

or the agdaâ€s harp had these two names it was called â€ak of the two
criesâ€ and â€and of fourfold musicâ€.

It leaped down from the wall, killing nine of the omors as it passed,
and came into the agdaâ€s hand. he agda played to the omors the three
tunes known to all clever harpistsâ€”the weepingtune, the laughingtune,
and the sleepingtune. While he played the weepingtune, they were bowed
with weeping while he played the laughingtune, they rocked with
laughter and when he played the sleepingtune, they all fell asleep.
And while they slept, ugh, the agda, and gma got away safely.

ext, the agda brought the blackmaned heifer which he had, by the
advice of Angus son of the Young, obtained from ress. he wisdom of
Angus had been shown in this advice, for it was this very heifer that
the cattle of the people of the goddess anu were accustomed to follow,
whenever it lowed. ow, when it lowed, all the cattle which the omors
had taken away from the uatha  anann came back again.

Yet the power of the omors was not wholly broken. our of them still
carried on a desultory warfare by spoiling the corn, fruit, and milk of
their conuerors. ut the Morrg and adb and Mider and Angus pursued
them, and drove them out of Ireland for ever.0

ast of all, the Morrg and adb went up on to the summits of all the
high mountains of Ireland, and proclaimed the victory. All the lesser
gods who had not been in the battle came round and heard the news. And
adb sang a song which began

                     â€eace mounts to the heavens,
                      he heavens descend to earth,
                      arth lies under the heavens,
                      veryone is strong ...â€,

but the rest of it has been lost and forgotten.

hen she added a prophecy in which she foretold the approaching end of
the divine age, and the beginning of a new one in which summers would be
flowerless and cows milkless and women shameless and men strengthless,
in which there would be trees without fruit and seas without fish, when
old men would give false udgments and legislators make unust laws,
when warriors would betray one another, and men would be thieves, and
there would be no more virtue left in the world.

f what adb had in mind when she uttered this prophecy we have no
record. ut it was true. he twilight of the Irish gods was at hand. A
new race was coming across the sea to dispute the ownership of Ireland
with the people of the goddess anu. And these newcomers were not
divinities like themselves, but men like ourselves, ancestors of the
Gaels.

his story of the conuest of the gods by mortalsâ€”which seems such a
strange one to usâ€”is typically Celtic. he Gaelic mythology is the only
one which has preserved it in any detail but the doctrine would seem to
have been common at one time to all the Celts. It was, however, of less
shame to the gods than would otherwise have been for men were of as
divine descent as themselves. he dogma of the Celts was that men were
descended from the god of death, and first came from the and of the
ead to take possession of the present world. Caesar tells us, in
his too short account of the Gauls, that they believed themselves to be
sprung from is ater, the god of the underworld.2 In the Gaelic
mythology is ater was called il, a name which has for root the
syllable bel, meaning â€to dieâ€. he god eli in ritish mythology was
no doubt the same person, while the same idea is expressed by the same
root in the name of alor, the terrible omor whose glance was
death.

he postChristian Irish chroniclers, seeking to reconcile Christian
teachings with the still vital pagan mythology by changing the gods into
ancient kings and incorporating them into the annals of the country,
with appropriate dates, also disposed of the genuine early doctrine by
substituting pain for ades, and giving a highlyfanciful account of
the origin and wanderings of their ancestors. o use a ibernicism,
appropriate in this connection, the first Irishman was a cythian called
enius arsa. eprived of his own throne, he had settled in gypt, where
his son iul married a daughter of the reigning haraoh. er name was
cta, and she had a son called Goidel, whose greatgrandson was named
ber cot, the whole genealogy being probably invented to explain the
origin of the three names by which the Gaels called themselvesâ€”inn,
cot, and Goidel. enius and his family and clan were turned out of
gypt for refusing to oin in the persecution of the children of Israel,
and soourned in Africa for fortytwo years. heir wanderings took them
to â€the altars of the hilistines, by the ake of siersâ€ then, passing
between usicada and the hilly country of yria, they travelled through
Mauretania as far as the illars of ercules and thence landed in
pain, where they lived many years, greatly increasing and multiplying.
he same route is given by the twelfthcentury ritish historian,
Geoffrey of Monmouth, as that taken by rutus and the roans when they
came to colonize ritain. Its only connection with any kind of fact
is that it corresponds fairly well with what ethnologists consider must
have been the westward line of migration taken, not, curiously enough,
by the Aryan Celts, but by the preAryan Iberians.

It is sufficient for us to find the first men in pain, remembering that
â€painâ€ stood for the Celtic ades, or lysium. In this country regon,
the father of two sons, il and Ith, had built a watchtower, from
which, one winterâ€s evening, Ith saw, far off over the seas, a land he
had never noticed before. â€It is on winter evenings, when the air is
pure, that manâ€s eyesight reaches farthestâ€, remarks the old tract
called the â€ook of Invasionsâ€, gravely accounting for the fact
that Ith saw Ireland from pain.

Wishing to examine it nearer, he set sail with thrice thirty warriors,
and landed without mishap at the mouth of the iver cn. he
country seemed to him to be uninhabited, and he marched with his men
towards the north. At last he reached Aileach, near the present town of
ondonderry.

ere he found the three reigning kings of the people of the goddess
anu, Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht, and Mac Grein, the sons of gma, and
grandsons of the agda. hese had succeeded uada the ilverhanded,
killed in the battle with the omors and had met, after burying their
predecessor in a tumulus called Grianan Aileach, which still stands on
the base of the Inishowen eninsula, between ough willy and ough
oyle, to divide his kingdom among them. nable to arrive at any
partition satisfactory to all, they appealed to the newcomer to
arbitrate.

he advice of Ith was moral rather than practical. â€Act according to the
laws of usticeâ€ was all that he would say to the claimants and then he
was indiscreet enough to burst into enthusiastic praises of Ireland for
its temperate climate and its richness in fruit, honey, wheat, and fish.
uch sentiments from a foreigner seemed to the uatha  anann
suggestive of a desire to take the country from them. hey conspired
together and treacherously killed Ith at a place since called â€Ithâ€s
lainâ€. hey, however, spared his followers, who returned to â€painâ€,
taking their dead leaderâ€s body with them. he indignation there was
great, and Mil, ilâ€s son and Ithâ€s nephew, determined to go to
Ireland and get revenge.

Mil therefore sailed with his eight sons and their wives. hirtysix
chiefs, each with his shipful of warriors, accompanied him. y the magic
arts of their druid, Amergin of the air nee, they discovered the exact
place at which Ith had landed before them, and put in to shore there.
wo alone failed to reach it alive. he wife of Amergin died during the
voyage, and Aranon, a son of Mil, on approaching the land, climbed to
the top of the mast to obtain a better view, and, falling off, was
drowned. he rest disembarked safely upon the first of May.

Amergin was the first to land. lanting his right foot on Irish soil, he
burst into a poem preserved in both the ook of ecan and the ook of
allymote. It is a good example of the pantheistic philosophy of
the Celtic races, and a very close parallel to it is contained in an
early Welsh poem, called the â€attle of the reesâ€, and attributed to
the famous bard aliesin. â€I am the wind that blows upon the sea,â€
sang Amergin â€I am the ocean wave I am the murmur of the surges I am
seven battalions I am a strong bull I am an eagle on a rock I am a
ray of the sun I am the most beautiful of herbs I am a courageous wild
boar I am a salmon in the water I am a lake upon a plain I am a
cunning artist I am a gigantic, swordwielding champion I can shift my
shape like a god. In what direction shall we go hall we hold our
council in the valley or on the mountaintop Where shall we make our
home What land is better than this island of the setting sun Where
shall we walk to and fro in peace and safety Who can find you clear
springs of water as I can Who can tell you the age of the moon but I
Who can call the fish from the depths of the sea as I can Who can cause
them to come near the shore as I can Who can change the shapes of the
hills and headlands as I can I am a bard who is called upon by
seafarers to prophesy. avelins shall be wielded to avenge our wrongs. I
prophesy victory. I end my song by prophesying all other good
things.â€

he Welsh bard aliesin sings in the same strain as the druid Amergin
his unity with, and therefore his power over, all nature, animate and
inanimate. â€I have been in many shapesâ€, he says, â€before I attained a
congenial form. I have been a narrow blade of a sword I have been a
drop in the air I have been a shining star I have been a word in a
book I have been a book in the beginning I have been a light in a
lantern a year and a half I have been a bridge for passing over
threescore rivers I have ourneyed as an eagle I have been a boat on
the sea I have been a director in battle I have been a sword in the
hand I have been a shield in fight I have been the string of a harp I
have been enchanted for a year in the foam of water. here is nothing in
which I have not been.â€ It is strange to find Gael and riton combining
to voice almost in the same words this doctrine of the mystical Celts,
who, while still in a state of semibarbarism, saw, with some of the
greatest of ancient and modern philosophers, the ne in the Many, and a
single ssence in all the manifold forms of life.

he Milesians for so, following the Irish annalists, it will be
convenient to call the first Gaelic settlers in Ireland began their
march on ara, which was the capital of the uatha  anann, as it had
been in earlier days the chief fortress of the ir olgs, and would in
later days be the dwelling of the high kings of Ireland. n their way
they met with a goddess called anba, the wife of Mac Cuill. he greeted
Amergin. â€If you have come to conuer Ireland,â€ she said, â€your cause is
no ust one.â€ â€Certainly it is to conuer it we have come,â€ replied
Amergin, without condescending to argue upon the abstract morality of
the matter. â€hen at least grant me one thing,â€ she asked. â€What is
thatâ€ replied Amergin. â€hat this island shall be called by my name.â€
â€It shall be,â€ replied Amergin.

A little farther on, they met a second goddess, otla, the wife of Mac
Cecht, who made the same reuest, and received the same answer from
Amergin.

ast of all, at isnech, the centre of Ireland, they came upon the third
of the ueens, riu, the wife of Mac Grein. â€Welcome, warriors,â€ she
cried. â€o you who have come from afar this island shall henceforth
belong, and from the setting to the rising sun there is no better land.
And your race will be the most perfect the world has ever seen.â€ â€hese
are fair words and a good prophecy,â€ said Amergin. â€It will be no thanks
to you,â€ broke in onn, Milâ€s eldest son. â€Whatever success we have we
shall owe to our own strength.â€ â€hat which I prophesy has no concern
with you,â€ retorted the goddess, â€and neither you nor your descendants
will live to enoy this island.â€ hen, turning to Amergin, she, too,
asked that Ireland might be called after her. â€It shall be its principal
name,â€ Amergin promised.

And so it has happened. f the three ancient names of Irelandâ€”anba,
otla, and riuâ€”the last, in its genitive form of â€rinnâ€, is the one
that has survived.

he invaders came to ara, then called rumcain, that is, the â€eautiful
illâ€. Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht, and Mac Grein met them, with all the host
of the Gaelic gods. As was usual, they held a parley. he people of the
goddess anu complained that they had been taken by surprise, and the
Milesians admitted that to invade a country without having first warned
its inhabitants was not strictly according to the courtesies of
chivalrous warfare. he uatha  anann proposed to the invaders that
they should leave the island for three days, during which they
themselves would decide whether to fight for their kingdom or to
surrender it but the Milesians did not care for this, for they knew
that, as soon as they were out of the island, the uatha  anann would
oppose them with druidical enchantments, so that they would not be able
to make a fresh landing. In the end, Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht, and Mac
Grein offered to submit the matter to the arbitration of Amergin, the
Milesiansâ€ own lawgiver, with the express stipulation that, if he gave
an obviously partial udgment, he was to suffer death at their hands.
onn asked his druid if he were prepared to accept this very delicate
duty. Amergin replied that he was, and at once delivered the first
udgment pronounced by the Milesians in Ireland.

 â€he men whom we found dwelling in the land, to them is possession due
    by right.
  It is therefore your duty to set out to sea over nine green waves
  And if you shall be able to effect a landing again in spite of them,
  You are to engage them in battle, and I adudge to you the land in
     which you found them living.
  I adudge to you the land wherein you found them dwelling, by the right
     of battle.
  ut although you may desire the land which these people possess, yet
     yours is the duty to show them ustice.
  I forbid you from inustice to those you have found in the land,
     however you may desire to obtain it.â€0

his udgment was considered fair by both parties. he Milesians retired
to their ships, and waited at a distance of nine wavesâ€ length from the
land until the signal was given to attack, while the uatha  anann,
drawn up upon the beach, were ready with their druidical spells to
oppose them.

he signal was given, and the Milesians bent to their oars. ut they had
hardly started before they discovered that a strong wind was blowing
straight towards them from the shore, so that they could make no
progress. At first they thought it might be a natural breeze, but onn
smelt magic in it. e sent a man to climb the mast of his ship, and see
if the wind blew as strong at that height as it did at the level of the
sea. he man returned, reporting that the air was uite still â€up
aloftâ€. vidently it was a druidical wind. ut Amergin soon coped with
it. ifting up his voice, he invoked the and of Ireland itself, a power
higher than the gods it sheltered.

                â€I invoke the land of riu
                 he shining, shining sea
                 he fertile, fertile hill
                 he wooded vale
                 he river abundant, abundant in water
                 he fishful, fishful lakeâ€

In such strain runs the original incantation, one of those magic
formulas whose power was held by ancient, and still is held by savage,
races to reside in their exact consecrated wording rather than in their
meaning. o us it sounds nonsense, and so no doubt it did to those who
put the old Irish mythical traditions into literary shape for a later
version expands and explains it as followsâ€”

     â€I implore that we may regain the land of rin,
      We who have come over the lofty waves,
      his land whose mountains are great and extensive,
      Whose streams are clear and numerous,
      Whose woods abound with various fruit,
      Its rivers and waterfalls are large and beautiful,
      Its lakes are broad and widely spread,
      It abounds with fountains on elevated grounds
      May we gain power and dominion over its tribes
      May we have kings of our own ruling at ara
      May ara be the regal residence of our many succeeding kings
      May the Milesians be the conuerors of its people
      May our ships anchor in its harbours
      May they trade along the coast of rin
      May remon be its first ruling monarch
      May the descendants of Ir and ber be mighty kings
      I implore that we may regain the land of rin,
                                  I imploreâ€

he incantation proved effectual. he and of Ireland was pleased to be
propitious, and the druidical wind dropped down.

ut success was not uite so easy as they had hoped. Manannn, son of
the sea and lord of headlands, shook his magic mantle at them, and
hurled a fresh tempest out over the deep. he galleys of the Milesians
were tossed helplessly on the waves many sank with their crews. onn
was among the lost, thus fulfilling riuâ€s prophecy, and three other
sons of Mil also perished. In the end, a broken remnant, after long
beating about the coasts, came to shore at the mouth of the iver oyne.
hey landed and Amergin, from the shore, invoked the aid of the sea as
he had already done that of the land.

                          â€ea full of fish
                           ertile land
                           ish swarming up
                           ish there
                           nderwave bird
                           Great fish
                           Crabâ€s hole
                           ish swarming up
                           ea full of fishâ€

which, being interpreted like the preceding charm, seems to have meant

 â€May the fishes of the sea crowd in shoals to the land for our use
  May the waves of the sea drive forth to the shore abundance of fish
  May the salmon swim abundantly into our nets
  May all kinds of fish come plentifully to us from the sea
  May its flatfishes also come in abundance
  his poem I compose at the seashore that fishes may swim in shoals to
     our coast.â€

hen, gathering their forces, they marched on the people of the goddess
anu.

wo battles were fought, the first in Glenn aisi, a valley of the
lieve Mish Mountains, south of ralee, and the second at ailtiu, now
called elltown. In both, the gods were beaten. heir three kings were
killed by the three surviving sons of Milâ€”Mac Cuill by ber, Mac Cecht
by remon, and Mac Grein by the druid Amergin. efeated and
disheartened, they gave in, and, retiring beneath the earth, left the
surface of the land to their conuerors.

rom this day begins the history of Ireland according to the annalists.
Milâ€s eldest son, onn, having perished, the kingdom fell by right to
the second, remon. ut ber, the third son, backed by his followers,
insisted upon a partition, and Ireland was divided into two eual parts.
At the end of a year, however, war broke out between the brothers ber
was killed in battle, and remon took the sole rule.

ut though mortals had conuered gods upon a scale unparalleled in
mythology, they had by no means entirely subdued them. eaten in battle,
the people of the goddess anu had yet not lost their divine attributes,
and could use them either to help or hurt. â€Great was the power of the
agdaâ€, says a tract preserved in the ook of einster, â€over the sons
of Mil, even after the conuest of Ireland for his subects destroyed
their corn and milk, so that they must needs make a treaty of peace with
the agda. ot until then, and thanks to his goodwill, were they able
to harvest corn and drink the milk of their cows.â€2 he basis of
this lost treaty seems to have been that the uatha  anann, though
driven from the soil, should receive homage and offerings from their
successors. We are told in the verse dinnsenchus of Mag lecht, thatâ€”

           â€ince the rule
            f remon, the noble man of grace,
            here was worshipping of stones
            ntil the coming of good atrick of Machaâ€.

ispossessed of upper earth, the gods had, however, to seek for new
homes. A council was convened, but its members were divided between two
opinions. ne section of them chose to shake the dust of Ireland off its
disinherited feet, and seek refuge in a paradise overseas, situate in
some unknown, and, except for favoured mortals, unknowable island of the
west, the counterpart in Gaelic myth of the ritish

                      ... â€islandvalley of Avilion
            Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,
            or ever wind blows loudly but it lies
            eepmeadowâ€d, happy, fair with orchardlawns
            And bowery hollows crownâ€d with summer seaâ€

â€”a land of perpetual pleasure and feasting, described variously as the
â€and of romiseâ€ ir airngir, the â€lain of appinessâ€ Mag
Mell, the â€and of the ivingâ€ irnambeo, the â€and of the
Youngâ€ irnang, and â€reasalâ€s Islandâ€ yreasail. Celtic
mythology is full of the beauties and wonders of this mystic country,
and the tradition of it has never died out. yreasail has been set
down on old maps as a reality again and again some pioneers in the
panish seas thought they had discovered it, and called the land they
found â€razilâ€ and it is still said, by lovers of old lore, that a
patient watcher, after long gazing westward from the westernmost shores
of Ireland or cotland, may sometimes be lucky enough to catch a glimpse
against the sunset of itsâ€”

      â€summer isles of den lying in darkpurple spheres of seaâ€.

f these divine emigrants the principal was Manannn son of r. ut,
though he had cast in his lot beyond the seas, he did not cease to visit
Ireland. An old Irish king, ran, the son of ebal, met him, according
to a seventhcentury poem, as ran ourneyed to, and Manannn from, the
earthly paradise. ran was in his boat, and Manannn was driving a
chariot over the tops of the waves, and he sang

         â€ran deems it a marvellous beauty
          In his coracle across the clear sea
          While to me in my chariot from afar
          It is a flowery plain on which he rides about.

         â€What is a clear sea
          or the prowed skiff in which ran is,
          hat is a happy plain with profusion of flowers
          o me from the chariot of two wheels.

         â€ran sees
          he number of waves beating across the clear sea
          I myself see in Mag Mon
          edheaded flowers without fault.

         â€eahorses glisten in summer
          As far as ran has stretched his glance
          ivers pour forth a stream of honey
          In the land of Manannn son of r.

         â€he sheen of the main, on which thou art,
          he white hue of the sea, on which thou rowest about,
          Yellow and azure are spread out,
          It is land, and is not rough.

         â€peckled salmon leap from the womb
          f the white sea, on which thou lookest
          hey are calves, they are coloured lambs
          With friendliness, without mutual slaughter.

         â€hough but one chariotrider is seen
          In Mag Mell of many flowers,
          here are many steeds on its surface,
          hough them thou seest not.

                                                 

         â€Along the top of a wood has swum
          hy coracle across ridges,
          here is a wood of beautiful fruit
          nder the prow of thy little skiff.

         â€A wood with blossom and fruit,
          n which is the vineâ€s veritable fragrance
          A wood without decay, without defect,
          n which are leaves of a golden hue.â€

And, after this singularly poetical enunciation of the philosophical and
mystical doctrine that all things are, under their diverse forms,
essentially the same, he goes on to describe to ran the beauties and
pleasures of the Celtic lysium.

ut there were othersâ€”indeed, the most partâ€”of the gods who refused to
expatriate themselves. or these residences had to be found, and the
agda, their new king, proceeded to assign to each of those who stayed
in Ireland a sdh. hese sdhe were barrows, or hillocks, each being
the door to an underground realm of inexhaustible splendour and delight,
according to the somewhat primitive ideas of the Celts. A description is
given of one which the agda kept for himself, and out of which his son
Angus cheated him, which will serve as a fair example of all. here were
appletrees there always in fruit, and one pig alive and another ready
roasted, and the supply of ale never failed. ne may still visit in
Ireland the sdhe of many of the gods, for the spots are known, and
the traditions have not died out. o r was given dh
ionnachaidh, now known as the â€ill of the White ieldâ€, on the
top of lieve uad, near ewtown amilton, in County Armagh. odb erg
received a sdh called by his own name, dh odb0, ust to the
south of ortumna, in Galway. Mider was given the sdh of ri eith,
now called lieve Golry, near Ardagh, in County ongford. gmaâ€s sdh
was called Airceltrai to ugh was assigned odrubn Manannnâ€s
son, Ilbhreach, received dh as Aedha uaidh, now the Mound of
Mullachshee, near allyshannon, in onegal ionnbharr2 had dh
Meadha, now â€nockmaâ€, about five miles west of uam, where, as present
king of the fairies, he is said to live today while the abodes of
other gods of lesser fame are also recorded. or himself the agda
retained two, both near the iver oyne, in Meath, the best of them
being the famous rughnaoyne. one of the members of the uatha 
anann were left unprovided for, save one.

It was from this time that the Gaelic gods received the name by which
the peasantry know them todayâ€”Aes dhe, the â€eople of the illsâ€,
or, more shortly, the dhe. very god, or fairy, is a
erdhe, a â€Man of the illâ€ and every goddess a eandhe,
a â€Woman of the illâ€, the banshee of popular legend.

he most famous of such fairy hills are about five miles from
rogheda. hey are still connected with the names of the uatha 
anann, though they are now not called their dwellingplaces, but their
tombs. n the northern bank of the oyne stand seventeen barrows, three
of whichâ€”nowth, owth, and ew Grangeâ€”are of great size. he last
named, largest, and best preserved, is over 00 feet in diameter, and 0
feet high, while its top makes a platform 20 feet across. It has been
explored, and oman coins, gold torues, copper pins, and iron rings and
knives have been found in it but what else it may have once contained
will never be known, for, like nowth and owth, it was thoroughly
ransacked by anish spoilers in the ninth century. It is entered by a
suare doorway, the rims of which are elaborately ornamented with a kind
of spiral pattern. his entrance leads to a stone passage, more than 0
feet long, which gradually widens and rises, until it opens into a
chamber with a conical dome 20 feet high. n each side of this central
chamber is a recess, with a shallow oval stone basin in it. he huge
slabs of which the whole is built are decorated upon both the outer and
the inner faces with the same spiral pattern as the doorway.

he origin of these astonishing prehistoric monuments is unknown, but
they are generally attributed to the race that inhabited Ireland before
the Celts. Gazing at marvellous ew Grange, one might very well echo the
words of the old Irish poet Mac ia, in the ook of allymote

          â€ehold the dh before your eyes,
           It is manifest to you that it is a kingâ€s mansion,
           Which was built by the firm agda,
           It was a wonder, a court, an admirable hill.â€

It is not, however, with ew Grange, or even with nowth or owth, that
the agdaâ€s name is now associated. It is a smaller barrow, nearer to
the oyne, which is known as the â€omb of the agdaâ€. It has never been
opened, and r. ames ergusson, the author of ude tone Monuments,
who holds the uatha  anann to have been a real people, thinks that
â€the bones and armour of the great agda may still be found in his
honoured graveâ€. ther Celtic scholars might not be so sanguine,
though verses as old as the eleventh century assert that the uatha 
anann used the brughs for burial. It was about this period that the
mythology of Ireland was being rewoven into spurious history. he poem,
which is called the â€Chronicles of the ombsâ€, not only mentions the
â€Monument of the agdaâ€ and the â€Monument of the Morrgâ€, but also
records the last restingplaces of gma, tain, Cairpr, ugh, oann,
and Angus.

We have for the present, however, to consider Angus in a far less
sepulchral light. e is, indeed, very much alive in the story to be
related. he â€on of the Youngâ€ was absent when the distribution of the
sdhe was made. When he returned, he came to his father, the agda,
and demanded one. he agda pointed out to him that they had all been
given away. Angus protested, but what could be done y fair means,
evidently nothing but by craft, a great deal. he wily Angus appeared
to reconcile himself to fate, and only begged his father to allow him to
stay at the sdh of rughnaoyne ew Grange for a day and a night.
he agda agreed to this, no doubt congratulating himself on having got
out of the difficulty so easily. ut when he came to Angus to remind him
that the time was up, Angus refused to go. e had been granted, he
claimed, day and night, and it is of days and nights that time and
eternity are composed therefore there was no limit to his tenure of the
sdh. he logic does not seem very convincing to our modern minds, but
the agda is said to have been satisfied with it. e abandoned the best
of his two palaces to his son, who took peaceable possession of it. hus
it got a second name, that of the dh or rugh of the â€on of the
Youngâ€.

he agda does not, after this, play much active part in the history of
the people of the goddess anu. We next hear of a council of gods to
elect a fresh ruler. here were five candidates for the vacant
throneâ€”odb the ed, Mider, Ilbhreach son of Manannn, r, and
Angus himself, though the lastnamed, we are told, had little real
desire to rule, as he preferred a life of freedom to the dignities of
kingship. he uatha  anann went into consultation, and the result of
their deliberation was that their choice fell upon odb the ed, for
three reasonsâ€”firstly, for his own sake secondly, for his father, the
agdaâ€s sake and thirdly, because he was the agdaâ€s eldest son. he
other competitors approved this choice, except two. Mider refused to
give hostages, as was the custom, to odb erg, and fled with his
followers to â€a desert country round Mount einsterâ€, in County Carlow,
while r retired in great anger to dh ionnachaidh, declining to
recognize or obey the new king.

Why r and Mider should have so taken the matter to heart is difficult
to understand, unless it was because they were both among the oldest of
the gods. he indifference of Angus is easier to explain. e was the
Gaelic ros, and was busy living up to his character. At this time, the
obect of his love was a maiden who had visited him one night in a
dream, only to vanish when he put out his arms to embrace her. All the
next day, we are told, Angus took no food. pon the following night, the
unsubstantial lady again appeared, and played and sang to him. hat
following day, he also fasted. o things went on for a year, while Angus
pined and wasted for love. At last the physicians of the uatha 
anann guessed his complaint, and told him how fatal it might be to him.
Angus asked that his mother oann might be sent for, and, when she came,
he told her his trouble, and implored her help. he went to the agda
and begged him, if he did not wish to see his son die of unreuited
love, a disease that all iancechtâ€s medicine and Goibniuâ€s magic could
not heal, to find the dreammaiden. he agda could do nothing himself,
but he sent to odb the ed, and the new king of the gods sent in turn
to the lesser deities of Ireland, ordering all of them to search for
her. or a year she could not be found, but at last the disconsolate
lover received a message, charging him to come and see if he could
recognize the lady of his dreams. Angus came, and knew her at once, even
though she was surrounded by thrice fifty attendant nymphs. er name was
Caer, and she was the daughter of tal Ambuel, who had a sdh at
aman, in Connaught. odb the ed demanded her for Angus in marriage,
but her father declared that he had no control over her. he was a
swanmaiden, he said and every year, as soon as summer was over, she
went with her companions to a lake called â€ragonMouthâ€, and there all
of them became swans. ut, refusing to be thus put off, Angus waited in
patience until the day of the magical change, and then went down to the
shore of the lake. here, surrounded by thrice fifty swans, he saw Caer,
herself a swan surpassing all the rest in beauty and whiteness. e
called to her, proclaiming his passion and his name, and she promised to
be his bride, if he too would become a swan. e agreed, and with a word
she changed him into swanshape, and thus they flew side by side to
Angusâ€s sdh, where they retook the human form, and, no doubt, lived
happily as long as could be expected of such changeable immortals as
pagan deities.0

Meanwhile, the people of the goddess anu were ustly incensed against
both r and Mider. odb the ed made a yearly war upon Mider in his
sdh, and many of the divine race were killed on either side. ut
against r, the new king of the gods refused to move, for there had
been a great affection between them. Many times odb erg tried to
regain râ€s friendship by presents and compliments, but for a long time
without success.

At last râ€s wife died, to the seagodâ€s great sorrow. When odb the
ed heard the news, he sent a messenger to r, offering him one of his
own fosterdaughters, Aebh, Aeife2, and Ailbhe, the
children of Ailioll of Arran. r, touched by this, came to visit odb
the ed at his sdh, and chose Aebh for his wife. â€he is the eldest,
so she must be the noblest of them,â€ he said. hey were married, and a
great feast made and r took her back with him to dh ionnachaidh.

Aebh bore four children to r. he eldest was a daughter called inola,
the second was a son called Aed the two others were twin boys called
iachra and Conn, but in giving birth to those Aebh died.

odb the ed then offered r another of his fosterchildren, and he
chose the second, Aeife. very year r and Aeife and the four children
used to go to Manannnâ€s â€east of Ageâ€, which was held at each of the
sdhe in turn. he four children grew up to be great favourites among
the people of the goddess anu.

ut Aeife was childless, and she became ealous of râ€s children for
she feared that he would love them more than he did her. he brooded
over this until she began, first to hope for, and then to plot their
deaths. he tried to persuade her servants to murder them, but they
would not. o she took the four children to ake arvra now called
ough erravargh in West Meath, and sent them into the water to bathe.
hen she made an incantation over them, and touched them, each in turn,
with a druidical wand, and changed them into swans.

ut, though she had magic enough to alter their shapes, she had not the
power to take away their human speech and minds. inola turned, and
threatened her with the anger of r and of odb the ed when they came
to hear of it. he, however, hardened her heart, and refused to undo
what she had done. he children of r, finding their case a hopeless
one, asked her how long she intended to keep them in that condition.

â€You would be easier in mind,â€ she said, â€if you had not asked the
uestion but I will tell you. You shall be three hundred years here, on
ake arvra and three hundred years upon the ea of Moyle, which
is between rin and Alba and three hundred years more at Irros
omnann and the Isle of Glora in rris. Yet you shall have two
consolations in your troubles you shall keep your human minds, and yet
suffer no grief at knowing that you have been changed into swans, and
you shall be able to sing the softest and sweetest songs that were ever
heard in the world.â€

hen Aeife went away and left them. he returned to r, and told him
that the children had fallen by accident into ake arvra, and were
drowned.

ut r was not satisfied that she spoke the truth, and went in haste to
the lake, to see if he could find traces of them. e saw four swans
close to the shore, and heard them talking to one another with human
voices. As he approached, they came out of the water to meet him. hey
told him what Aeife had done, and begged him to change them back into
their own shapes. ut râ€s magic was not so powerful as his wifeâ€s, and
he could not.

or even could odb the edâ€”to whom r went for help,â€”for all that he
was king of the gods. What Aeife had done could not be undone. ut she
could be punished for it odb ordered his fosterdaughter to appear
before him, and, when she came, he put an oath on her to tell him truly
â€what shape of all others, on the earth, or above the earth, or beneath
the earth, she most abhorred, and into which she most dreaded to be
transformedâ€. Aeife was obliged to answer that she most feared to become
a demon of the air. o odb the ed struck her with his wand, and she
fled from them, a shrieking demon.

All the uatha  anann went to ake arvra to visit the four swans.
he Milesians heard of it, and also went for it was not till long after
this that gods and mortals ceased to associate. he visit became a
yearly feast. ut, at the end of three hundred years, the children of
r were compelled to leave ake arvra, and go to the ea of Moyle, to
fulfil the second period of their exile.

hey bade farewell to gods and men, and went. And, for fear lest they
might be hurt by anyone, the Milesians made it law in Ireland that no
man should harm a swan, from that time forth for ever.

he children of r suffered much from tempest and cold on the stormy
ea of Moyle, and they were very lonely. nce only during that long
three hundred years did they see any of their friends. An embassy of the
uatha  anann, led by two sons of odb the ed, came to look for
them, and told them all that had happened in rin during their exile.

At last that long penance came to an end, and they went to Irros omnann
and Innis Glora for their third stage. And while it was wearily dragging
through, aint atrick came to Ireland, and put an end to the power of
the gods for ever. hey had been banned and banished when the children
of r found themselves free to return to their old home. dh
ionnechaidh was empty and deserted, for r had been killed by Caoilt,
the cousin of inn mac Coul.

o, after long, vain searching for their lost relatives, they gave up
hope, and returned to the Isle of Glora. hey had a friend there, the
onely Crane of Inniskea, which has lived upon that island ever
since the beginning of the world, and will be still sitting there on the
day of udgment. hey saw no one else until, one day, a man came to the
island. e told them that he was aint Caemhoc, and that he had
heard their story. e brought them to his church, and preached the new
faith to them, and they believed on Christ, and consented to be
baptised. his broke the pagan spell, and, as soon as the holy water was
sprinkled over them, they returned to human shape. ut they were very
old and bowedâ€”three aged men and an ancient woman. hey did not live
long after this, and aint Caemhoc, who had baptised them, buried them
all together in one grave.0

ut, in telling this story, we have leaped nine hundred yearsâ€”a great
space in the history even of gods. We must retrace our steps, if not
uite to the days of remon and ber, sons of Mil, and first kings of
Ireland, at any rate to the beginning of the Christian era.

At this time ochaid Airem was high king of Ireland, and reigned at
ara while, under him, as vassal monarchs, Conchobar mac essa ruled
over the ed ranch Champions of lster Curoi son of aire, was
king of Munster Mesgegra was king of einster and Ailell, with his
famous ueen, Medb, governed Connaught.

hortly before, among the gods, Angus on of the Young, had stolen away
tain, the wife of Mider. e kept her imprisoned in a bower of glass,
which he carried everywhere with him, never allowing her to leave it,
for fear Mider might recapture her. he Gaelic luto, however, found out
where she was, and was laying plans to rescue her, when a rival of
tainâ€s herself decoyed Angus away from before the pleasant
prisonhouse, and set his captive free. ut, instead of returning her to
Mider, she changed the luckless goddess into a fly, and threw her into
the air, where she was tossed about in great wretchedness at the mercy
of every wind.

At the end of seven years, a gust blew her on to the roof of the house
of tair, one of the vassals of Conchobar, who was celebrating a feast.
he unhappy fly, who was tain, was blown down the chimney into the room
below, and fell, exhausted, into a golden cup full of beer, which the
wife of the master of the house was ust going to drink. And the woman
drank tain with the beer.

ut, of course, this was not the end of herâ€”for the gods cannot really
die,â€”but only the beginning of a new life. tain was reborn as the
daughter of tairâ€s wife, no one knowing that she was not of mortal
lineage. he grew up to be the most beautiful woman in Ireland.

When she was twenty years old, her fame reached the high king, who sent
messengers to see if she was as fair as men reported. hey saw her, and
returned to the king full of her praises. o ochaid himself went to pay
her a visit. e chose her to be his ueen, and gave her a splendid
dowry.

It was not till then that Mider heard of her. e came to her in the
shape of a young man, beautifully dressed, and told her who she really
was, and how she had been his wife among the people of the goddess anu.
e begged her to leave the king, and come with him to his sdh at ri
eith. ut tain refused with scorn.

â€o you think,â€ she said, â€that I would give up the high king of Ireland
for a person whose name and kindred I do not know, except from his own
lipsâ€

he god retired, baffled for the time. ut one day, as ing ochaid sat
in his hall, a stranger entered. e was dressed in a purple tunic, his
hair was like gold, and his eyes shone like candles.

he king welcomed him.

â€ut who are youâ€ he asked â€for I do not know you.â€

â€Yet I have known you a long time,â€ returned the stranger.

â€hen what is your nameâ€

â€ot a very famous one. I am Mider of ri eith.â€

â€Why have you come hereâ€

â€o challenge you to a game of chess.â€

â€I am a good chessplayer,â€ replied the king, who was reputed to be the
best in Ireland.

â€I think I can beat you,â€ answered Mider.

â€ut the chessboard is in the ueenâ€s room, and she is asleep,â€
obected ochaid.

â€It does not matter,â€ replied Mider. â€I have brought a board with me
which can be in no way worse than yours.â€

e showed it to the king, who admitted that the boast was true. he
chessboard was made of silver set in precious stones, and the pieces
were of gold.

â€layâ€ said Mider to the king.

â€I never play without a wager,â€ replied ochaid.

â€What shall be the stakeâ€ asked Mider.

â€I do not care,â€ replied ochaid.

â€Goodâ€ returned Mider. â€et it be that the loser pays whatever the
winner demands.â€

â€hat is a wager fit for a king,â€ said ochaid.

hey played, and Mider lost. he stake that ochaid claimed from him was
that Mider and his subects should make a road through Ireland. ochaid
watched the road being made, and noticed how Miderâ€s followers yoked
their oxen, not by the horns, as the Gaels did, but at the shoulders,
which was better. e adopted the practice, and thus got his nickname,
Airem, that is, â€he loughmanâ€.

After a year, Mider returned and challenged the king again, the terms to
be the same as before. ochaid agreed with oy but, this time, he lost.

â€I could have beaten you before, if I had wished,â€ said Mider, â€and now
the stake I demand is tain, your ueen.â€

he astonished king, who could not for shame go back upon his word,
asked for a yearâ€s delay. Mider agreed to return upon that day year to
claim tain. ochaid consulted with his warriors, and they decided to
keep watch through the whole of the day fixed by Mider, and let no one
pass in or out of the royal palace till sunset. or ochaid held that if
the fairy king could not get tain upon that one day, his promise would
be no longer binding on him.

o, when the day came, they barred the door and guarded it, but suddenly
they saw Mider among them in the hall. e stood beside tain, and sang
this song to her, setting out the pleasures of the homes of the gods
under the enchanted hills.

       â€ fair lady will you come with me
        o a wonderful country which is mine,
        Where the peopleâ€s hair is of golden hue,
        And their bodies the colour of virgin snow

       â€here no grief or care is known
        White are their teeth, black their eyelashes
        elight of the eye is the rank of our hosts,
        With the hue of the foxglove on every cheek.

       â€Crimson are the flowers of every mead,
        Gracefully speckled as the blackbirdâ€s egg
        hough beautiful to see be the plains of Inisfail2
        hey are but commons compared to our great plains.

       â€hough intoxicating to you be the aledrink of Inisfail,
        More intoxicating the ales of the great country
        he only land to praise is the land of which I speak,
        Where no one ever dies of decrepit age.

       â€oft sweet streams traverse the land
        he choicest of mead and of wine
        eautiful people without any blemish
        ove without sin, without wickedness.

       â€We can see the people upon all sides,
        ut by no one can we be seen
        he cloud of Adamâ€s transgression it is
        hat prevents them from seeing us.

       â€ lady, should you come to my brave land,
        It is golden hair that will be on your head
        resh pork, beer, new milk, and ale,
        You there with me shall have,  fair ladyâ€

hen Mider greeted ochaid, and told him that he had come to take away
tain, according to the kingâ€s wager. And, while the king and his
warriors looked on helplessly, he placed one arm round the now willing
woman, and they both vanished. his broke the spell that hung over
everyone in the hall they rushed to the door, but all they could see
were two swans flying away.

he king would not, however, yield to the god. e sent to every part of
Ireland for news of tain, but his messengers all came back without
having been able to find her. At last, a druid named aln learned, by
means of ogams carved upon wands of yew, that she was hidden under
Miderâ€s sdh of ri eith. o ochaid marched there with an army, and
began to dig deep into the abode of the gods of which the â€fairy hillâ€
was the portal. Mider, as terrified as was the Greek god ades when it
seemed likely that the earth would be rent open, and his domains
laid bare to the sight, sent out fifty fairy maidens to ochaid, every
one of them having the appearance of tain. ut the king would only be
content with the real tain, so that Mider, to save his sdh, was at
last obliged to give her up. And she lived with the ing of Ireland
after that until the death of both of them.

ut Mider never forgave the insult. e bided his time for three
generations, until ochaid and tain had a male descendant. or they had
no son, but only a daughter called tain, like her mother, and this
second tain had a daughter called Messbuachallo, who had a son called
Conair, surnamed â€the Greatâ€. Mider and the gods wove the web of fate
round Conair, so that he and all his men died violent deaths.

                             II IIA


With ber and remon, sons of Mil, and conuerors of the gods, begins a
fresh series of characters in Gaelic traditionâ€”the early â€Milesianâ€
kings of Ireland. hough monkish chroniclers have striven to find
history in the legends handed down concerning them, they are none the
less almost as mythical as the uatha  anann. he first of them who
has the least appearance of reality is igernmas, who is recorded to
have reigned a hundred years after the coming of the Milesians. e seems
to have been what is sometimes called a â€Culturekingâ€, bearing much the
same kind of relation to Ireland as heseus bore to Athens or Minos to
Crete. uring his reign, nine new lakes and three new rivers broke forth
from beneath the earth to give their waters to rin. nder his auspices,
gold was first smelted, ornaments of gold and silver were first made,
and clothes first dyed. e is said to have perished mysteriously
with threefourths of the men of rin while worshipping Cromm Cruaich on
the field of Mag lecht. In him Mr. utt sees, no doubt rightly, the
great mythical king who, in almost all national histories, closes the
strictly mythological age, and inaugurates a new era of less obviously
divine, if hardly less apocryphal characters.

In spite, however, of the worship of the uatha  anann instituted by
remon, we find the early kings and heroes of Ireland walking very
familiarly with their gods. ochaid Airem, high king of Ireland, was
apparently reckoned a perfectly fit suitor for the goddess tain, and
proved a far from unsuccessful rival of Mider, the Gaelic luto.
And adventures of love or war were carried uite as cheerfully among the
sdh dwellers by ochaidâ€s contemporariesâ€”Conchobar son of essa, ing
of lster, Curoi son of aire, ing of Munster, Mesgegra, ing of
einster, and Ailell and Medb, ing and ueen of Connaught.

All these figures of the second Gaelic cycle that of the heroes of
lster, and especially of their great champion, Cuchulainn lived,
according to Irish tradition, at about the beginning of the Christian
era. Conchobar, indeed, is said to have expired in a fit of rage on
hearing of the death of Christ.0

ut this is a very transparent monkish interpolation into the original
story. A uite different view is taken by most modern scholars, who
would see gods and not men in all the legendary characters of the Celtic
heroic cycles. pon such a subect, however, one may legitimately take
sides. Were ing Conchobar and his ltonian champions, inn and his
enians, Arthur and his nights once living men round whom the
attributes of gods have gathered, or were they ancient deities renamed
and stripped of some of their divinity to make them more akin to their
human worshippers istory or mythology A mingling, perhaps, of both.
Cuchulainn may have been the name of a real Gaelic warrior, however
suspiciously he may now resemble the sungod, who is said to have been
his father. ing Conchobar may have been the real chief of a tribe of
Irish Celts before he became an adumbration of the Gaelic skygod. It is
the same problem that confronts us in dealing with the heroic legends of
Greece and ome. Were Achilles, Agamemnon, dysseus, aris, neas gods,
demigods, or men et us call them all alikeâ€”whether they be Greek or
roan heroes, ed ranch Champions, or followers of the Gaelic inn or
the ritish Arthurâ€”demigods. ven so, they stand definitely apart from
the older gods who were greater than they were.

We are stretching no point in calling them demigods, for they were
goddescended.2 Cuchulainn, the greatest hero of the lster cycle,
was doubly so for on his motherâ€s side he was the grandson of the
agda, while ugh of the ong and is said to have been his father. is
mother, echtir, daughter of Maga, the daughter of Angus â€on of the
Youngâ€, was halfsister to ing Conchobar, and all the other principal
heroes were of hardly less lofty descent. It is small wonder that they
are described in ancient manuscripts as terrestrial gods and
goddesses.

â€errestrialâ€ they may have been in form, but their acts were
superhuman. Indeed, compared with the more modest exploits of the heroes
of the â€Iliadâ€, they were those of giants. Where Greek warriors slew
their tens, these ltonians despatched their hundreds. hey came home
after such exploits so heated that their cold baths boiled over. When
they sat down to meat, they devoured whole oxen, and drank their mead
from vats. With one stroke of their favourite swords they beheaded hills
for sport. he gods themselves hardly did more, and it is easy to
understand that in those old days not only might the sons of gods look
upon the daughters of men and find them fair, but immortal women also
need not be too proud to form passing alliances with mortal men.

ome of the older deities seem to have already passed out of memory at
the time of the compilation of the lster cycle. At any rate, they make
no appearance in it. ead uada rests in the grianan of Aileach gma
lies low in sdh Airceltrai while the agda, thrust into the
background by his son Angus, mixes himself very little in the affairs of
rin. ut the Morrg is no less eager in encouraging human or
semidivine heroes to war than she was when she revived the fainting
spirits of the folk of the goddess anu at the attle of Moytura. he
gods who appear most often in the cycle of the ed ranch of lster are
the same that have lived on throughout with the most persistent
vitality. ugh the onghanded, Angus of the rugh, Mider, odb the ed,
and Manannn son of r, are the principal deities that move in the
background of the stage where the chief parts are now played by mortals.
ut, to make up for the loss of some of the greater divine figures, the
ranks of the gods are being recruited from below. All manner of inferior
divinities claim to be members of the tribe of the goddess anu. he
goblins and sprites and demons of the air who shrieked around battles
are described collectively as uatha  anann.

As for the omors, they have lost their distinctive names, though they
are still recognized as dwellers beneath the deep, who at times raid
upon the coast, and do battle with the heroes over whom Conchobar ruled
at main Macha.

his seat of his government, the traditionary site of which is still
marked by an extensive prehistoric entrenchment called avan ort,
near Armagh, was the centre of an lster that stretched southwards as
far as the oyne, and round its ruler gathered such a galaxy of warriors
as Ireland had never seen before, or will again. hey called themselves
the â€Champions of the ed ranchâ€ there was not one of them who was not
a hero but they are all dwarfed by one splendid figureâ€”Cuchulainn,
whose name means â€Culannâ€s oundâ€. Mr. Alfred utt calls him â€the Irish
Achillesâ€, while rofessor hys would rather see in him a eracles
of the Gaels. ike Achilles, he was the chosen hero of his people,
invincible in battle, and yet â€at once to early death and sorrows doomed
beyond the lot of manâ€, while, like eracles, his life was a series of
wonderful exploits and labours. It matters little enough for the lives
of all such mythical heroes must be of necessity somewhat alike.

If Achilles and eracles were, as some think, personifications of the
sun, Cuchulainn is not less so. Most of his attributes, as the old
stories record them, are obviously solar symbols. e seemed generally
small and insignificant, yet, when he was at his full strength, no one
could look him in the face without blinking, while the heat of his
constitution melted snow for thirty feet all round him. e turned red
and hissed as he dipped his body into its bathâ€”the sea. errible was his
transformation when sorely oppressed by his enemies, as the sun is by
mist, storm, or eclipse. At such times â€among the arial clouds over his
head were visible the virulent pouring showers and sparks of ruddy fire
which the seething of his savage wrath caused to mount up above him. is
hair became tangled about his head, as it had been branches of a red
thornbush stuffed into a stronglyfenced gap.... aller, thicker, more
rigid, longer than mast of a great ship was the perpendicular et of
dusky blood which out of his scalpâ€s very central point shot upwards and
then was scattered to the four cardinal points whereby was formed a
magic mist of gloom resembling the smoky pall that drapes a regal
dwelling, what time a king at nightfall of a winterâ€s day draws near to
it.â€

o marvellous a being200 was, of course, of marvellous birth. is
mother, echtir, was on the point of being married to an lster
chieftain called ualtam, and was sitting at the weddingfeast, when a
mayfly flew into her cup of wine and was unwittingly swallowed by her.
hat same afternoon she fell into a deep sleep, and in her dream the
sungod ugh appeared to her, and told her that it was he whom she had
swallowed, and bore within her. e ordered her and her fifty attendant
maidens to come with him at once, and he put upon them the shapes of
birds, so that they were not seen to go. othing was heard of them
again. ut one day, months later, a flock of beautiful birds appeared
before main Macha, and drew out its warriors in their chariots to hunt
them.

hey followed the birds till nightfall, when they found themselves at
the rugh on the oyne, where the great gods had their homes. As they
looked everywhere for shelter, they suddenly saw a splendid palace. A
tall and handsome man, richly dressed, came out and welcomed them and
led them in. Within the hall were a beautiful and noblefaced woman and
fifty maidens, and on the tables were the richest meats and wines, and
everything fit for the needs of warriors. o they rested there the
night, and, during the night, they heard the cry of a newborn child.
he next morning, the man told them who he was, and that the woman was
Conchobarâ€s halfsister echtir, and he ordered them to take the child,
and bring it up among the warriors of lster. o they brought him back,
together with his mother and the maidens, and echtir married ualtam,
and all the chiefs, champions, druids, poets, and lawgivers of lster
vied with one another in bringing up the mysterious infant.

At first they called him etanta and this is how he came to change his
name. While still a child, he was the strongest of the boys of main
Macha, and the champion in their sports. ne day he was playing hurley
singlehanded against all the others, and beating them, when Conchobar
the ing rode by with his nobles on the way to a banuet given by
Culann, the chief smith of the ltonians. Conchobar called to the boy,
inviting him to go with them, and he replied that, when the game was
finished, he would follow. As soon as the lster champions were in
Culannâ€s hall, the smith asked the kingâ€s leave to unloose his terrible
watchdog, which was as strong and fierce as a hundred hounds and
Conchobar, forgetting that the boy was to follow them, gave his
permission. Immediately the hound saw etanta coming, it rushed at him,
openmouthed. ut the boy flung his playingball into its mouth, and
then, seizing it by the hindlegs, dashed it against a rock till he had
killed it.

he smith Culann was very angry at the death of his dog for there was
no other hound in the world like him for guarding a house and flocks. o
etanta promised to find and train up another one, not less good, for
Culann, and, until it was trained, to guard the smithâ€s house as though
he were a dog himself. his is why he was called Cuchulainn, that is,
â€Culannâ€s oundâ€ and Cathbad the ruid prophesied that the time would
come when the name would be in every manâ€s mouth.

ot long after this, Cuchulainn overheard Cathbad giving druidical
instruction, and one of his pupils asking him what that day would be
propitious for. Cathbad replied that, if any young man first took arms
on that day, his name would be greater than that of any other heroâ€s,
but his life would be short. At once, the boy went to ing Conchobar,
and demanded arms and a chariot. Conchobar asked him who had put such a
thought into his head and he answered that it was Cathbad the ruid. o
Conchobar gave him arms and armour, and sent him out with a charioteer.
hat evening, Cuchulainn brought back the heads of three champions who
had killed many of the warriors of lster. e was then only seven years
old.

he women of lster so loved Cuchulainn after this that the warriors
grew ealous, and insisted that a wife should be found for him. ut
Cuchulainn was very hard to please. e would have only one, mer20,
the daughter of orgall the Wily, the best maiden in Ireland for the six
giftsâ€”the gift of beauty, the gift of voice, the gift of sweet speech,
the gift of needlework, the gift of wisdom, and the gift of chastity. o
he went to woo her, but she laughed at him for a boy. hen Cuchulainn
swore by the gods of his people that he would make his name known
wherever the deeds of heroes were spoken of, and mer promised to marry
him if he could take her from her warlike kindred.

When orgall, her father, came to know of this betrothal, he devised a
plan to put an end to it. e went to visit ing Conchobar at main
Macha. here he pretended to have heard of Cuchulainn for the first
time, and he saw him do all his feats. e said, loud enough to be
overheard by all, that if so promising a youth dared to go to the Island
of cathach the Amazon, in the east of Alba,202 and learn all her
warriorcraft, no living man would be able to stand before him. It was
hard to reach cathachâ€s Isle, and still harder to return from it, and
orgall felt certain that, if Cuchulainn went, he would get his death
there.

f course, nothing would now satisfy Cuchulainn but going. is two
friends, aegaire the attlewinner and Conall the ictorious, said that
they would go with him. ut, before they had gone far, they lost heart
and turned back. Cuchulainn went on alone, crossing the lain of
Illuck, where menâ€s feet stuck fast, while sharp grasses sprang up and
cut them, and through the erilous Glens, full of devouring wild beasts,
until he came to the ridge of the Cliff, which rose on end, till it
stood straight up like a shipâ€s mast, as soon as anyone put foot on it.
hree times Cuchulainn tried to cross it, and thrice he failed. hen
anger came into his heart, and a magic halo shone round his head, and he
did his famous feat of the â€heroâ€s salmon leapâ€, and landed, in one
ump, on the middle of the bridge, and then slid down it as it rose up
on end.

cathach was in the dn, with her two sons. Cuchulainn went to her,
and put his sword to her breast, and threatened to kill her if she would
not teach him all her own skill in arms. o he became her pupil, and she
taught him all her warcraft. In return, Cuchulainn helped her against a
rival ueen of the Amazons, called Aoife20. e conuered Aoife, and
compelled her to make peace with cathach.

hen he returned to Ireland, and went in a scythed chariot to orgallâ€s
palace. e leaped over its triple walls, and slew everyone who came near
him. orgall met his death in trying to escape Cuchulainnâ€s rage. e
found mer, and placed her in his chariot, and drove away and, every
time that orgallâ€s warriors came up to them, he turned, and slew a
hundred, and put the rest to flight. e reached main Macha in safety,
and he and mer were married there.

And so great, after this, were the fame of Cuchulainnâ€s prowess and
merâ€s beauty that the men and women of lster yielded them
precedenceâ€”him among the warriors and her among the womenâ€”in every feast
and banuet at main Macha.

ut all that Cuchulainn had done up to this time was as nothing to the
deeds he did in the great war which all the rest of Ireland, headed by
Ailill and Medb, ing and ueen of Connaught, made upon lster, to get
the rown ull of Cualgne.20 his ull was one of two, of fairy
descent. hey had originally been the swineherds of two of the gods,
odb, ing of the dhe of Munster, and chall chne, ing of the dhe
of Connaught. As swineherds they were in perpetual rivalry then, the
better to carry on their uarrel, they changed themselves into two
ravens, and fought for a year next they turned into watermonsters,
which tore one another for a year in the uir and a year in the hannon
then they became human again and fought as champions and ended by
changing into eels. ne of these eels went into the iver Cruind, in
Cualgne20, in lster, where it was swallowed by a cow belonging to
aire of Cualgne, and the other into the spring of aran Garad, in
Connaught, where it passed into the belly of a cow of ueen Medbâ€s. hus
were born those two famous beasts, the rown ull of lster and the
Whitehorned ull of Connaught.

ow the Whitehorned was of such proud mind that he scorned to belong to
a woman, and he went out of Medbâ€s herds into those of her husband
Ailill. o that when Ailill and Medb one day, in their idleness, counted
up their possessions, to set them off one against the other, although
they were eual in every other thing, in ewels and clothes and
household vessels, in sheep and horses and swine and cattle, Medb had no
one bull that was worthy to be set beside Ailillâ€s Whitehorned.
efusing to be less in anything than her husband, the proud ueen sent
heralds, with gifts and compliments, to aire, asking him to lend her
the rown ull for a year. aire would have done so gladly had not one
of Medbâ€s messengers been heard boasting in his cups that, if aire had
not lent the rown ull of his own freewill, Medb would have taken it.
his was reported to aire, who at once swore that she should never have
it. Medbâ€s messenger returned and the ueen of Connaught, furious at
his refusal, vowed that she would take it by force.

he assembled the armies of all the rest of Ireland to go against
lster, and made ergus son of oy, an lster champion who had
uarrelled with ing Conchobar, its leader. hey expected to have an
easy victory, for the warriors of lster were at that time lying under a
magic weakness which fell upon them for many days in each year, as the
result of a curse laid upon them, long before, by a goddess who had been
insulted by one of Conchobarâ€s ancestors. Medb called up a prophetess of
her people to foretell victory. â€ow do you see our hostsâ€ asked the
ueen of the seeress. â€I see crimson on them I see red,â€ she replied.
â€ut the warriors of lster are lying in their sickness. ay, how do you
see our menâ€ â€I see them all crimson I see them all red,â€ she
repeated. And then she added to the astonished ueen, who had expected a
uite different foretelling â€or I see a small man doing deeds of arms,
though there are many wounds on his smooth skin the herolight shines
round his head, and there is victory on his forehead he is richly
clothed, and young and beautiful and modest, but he is a dragon in
battle. is appearance and his valour are those of Cuchulainn of
Muirthemne who that â€Culannâ€s houndâ€ from Muirthemne may be, I do not
know but I know this, that all our army will be reddened by him. e is
setting out for battle he will hew down your hosts the slaughter he
shall make will be long remembered there will be many women crying over
the bodies mangled by the ound of the orge whom I see before me
now.â€20 or Cuchulainn was, for some reason unknown to us, the only
man in lster who was not subect to the magic weakness, and therefore
it fell upon him to defend lster singlehanded against the whole of
Medbâ€s army.

In spite of the inury done him by ing Conchobar, ergus still kept a
love for his own country. e had not the heart to march upon the
ltonians without first secretly sending a messenger to warn them. o
that, though all the other champions of the ed ranch were helpless,
Cuchulainn was watching the marches when the army came.

ow begins the story of the aristeia of the Gaelic hero. It is, after
the manner of epics, the record of a series of single combats, in each
of which Cuchulainn slays his adversary. Man after man comes against
him, and not one goes back. In the intervals between these duels,
Cuchulainn harasses the army with his sling, slaying a hundred men a
day. e kills Medbâ€s pet dog, bird, and suirrel, and creates such
terror that no one dares to stir out of the camp. Medb herself has a
narrow escape for one of her servingwomen, who puts on her mistressâ€s
golden headdress, is killed by a stone flung from Cuchulainnâ€s sling.

he great ueen determines to see with her own eyes this marvellous hero
who is holding all her warriors at bay. he sends an envoy, asking him
to come and parley with her. Cuchulainn agrees, and, at the meeting,
Medb is amazed at his boyish look. he finds it hard to believe that it
is this beardless stripling of seventeen who is killing her champions,
until the whole army seems as though it were melting away. he offers
him her own friendship and great honours and possessions in Connaught if
he will forsake Conchobar. e refuses but she offers it again and
again. At last Cuchulainn indignantly declares that the next man who
comes with such a message will do so at his peril. ne bargain, however,
he will make. e is willing to fight one of the men of Ireland every
day, and, while the duel lasts, the main army may march on but, as soon
as Cuchulainn has killed his man, it must halt until the next day. Medb
agrees to this, thinking it better to lose one man a day than a hundred.

Medb makes the same offer to every famous warrior, to induce him to go
against Cuchulainn. he reward for the head of the champion will be the
hand of her daughter, indabair20. In spite of this, not one of the
aspirants to the princess can stand before Cuchulainn. All perish and
indabair, when she finds out how she is being promised to a fresh
suitor every day, dies of shame. ut, while Cuchulainn is engaged in
these combats, Medb sends men who scour lster for the brown bull, and
find him, and drive him, with fifty heifers, into her camp.

Meanwhile the s dhe, the fairy godclan, are watching the
halfdivine, halfmortal hero, amazed at his achievements. is exploits
kindle love in the fierce heart of the Morrg, the great wargoddess.
Cuchulainn is awakened from sleep by a terrible shout from the north. e
orders his driver, aeg, to yoke the horses to his chariot, so that he
may find out who raised it. hey go in the direction from which the
sound had come, and meet with a woman in a chariot drawn by a red horse.
he has red eyebrows, and a red dress, and a long, red cloak, and she
carries a great, gray spear. e asks her who she is, and she tells him
that she is a kingâ€s daughter, and that she has fallen in love with him
through hearing of his exploits. Cuchulainn says that he has other
things to think of than love. he replies that she has been giving him
her help in his battles, and will still do so and Cuchulainn answers
that he does not need any womanâ€s help. â€hen,â€ says she, â€if you will
not have my love and help, you shall have my hatred and enmity. When you
are fighting with a warrior as good as yourself, I will come against you
in various shapes and hinder you, so that he shall have the advantage.â€
Cuchulainn draws his sword, but all he sees is a hoodie crow sitting on
a branch. e knows from this that the red woman in the chariot was the
great ueen of the gods.

he next day, a warrior named och went to meet Cuchulainn. At first he
refused to fight one who was beardless so Cuchulainn smeared his chin
with blackberry uice, until it looked as though he had a beard. While
Cuchulainn was fighting och, the Morrg came against him three
timesâ€”first as a heifer which tried to overthrow him, and next as an eel
which got beneath his feet as he stood in running water, and then as a
wolf which seized hold of his right arm. ut Cuchulainn broke the
heiferâ€s leg, and trampled upon the eel, and put out one of the wolfâ€s
eyes, though, every one of these three times, och wounded him. In the
end, Cuchulainn slew och with his invincible spear, the gae
bolg20, made of a seamonsterâ€s bones. he Morrg came back to
Cuchulainn, disguised as an old woman, to have her wounds healed by him,
for no one could cure them but he who had made them. he became his
friend after this, and helped him.

ut the fighting was so continuous that Cuchulainn got no sleep, except
ust for a while, from time to time, when he might rest a little, with
his head on his hand and his hand on his spear and his spear on his
knee. o that his father, ugh the onghanded, took pity on him and
came to him in the semblance of a tall, handsome man in a green cloak
and a goldembroidered silk shirt, and carrying a black shield and a
fivepronged spear. e put him into a sleep of three days and three
nights, and, while he rested, he laid druidical herbs on to all his
wounds, so that, in the end, he rose up again completely healed and as
strong as at the very beginning of the war. While he was asleep, the
boytroop of main Macha, Cuchulainnâ€s old companions, came and fought
instead of him, and slew three times their own number, but were all
killed.

It was at this time that Medb asked ergus to go and fight with
Cuchulainn. ergus answered that he would never fight against his own
fosterson. Medb asked him again and again, and at last he went, but
without his famous sword. â€ergus, my guardian,â€ said Cuchulainn, â€it is
not safe for you to come out against me without your sword.â€ â€If I had
the sword,â€ replied ergus, â€I would not use it on you.â€ hen ergus
asked Cuchulainn, for the sake of all he had done for him in his
boyhood, to pretend to fight with him, and then give way before him and
run away. Cuchulainn answered that he was very loth to be seen running
from any man. ut ergus promised Cuchulainn that, if Cuchulainn would
run away from ergus then, ergus would run away from Cuchulainn at some
future time, whenever Cuchulainn wished. Cuchulainn agreed to this, for
he knew that it would be for the profit of lster. o they fought a
little, and then Cuchulainn turned and fled in the sight of all Medbâ€s
army. ergus went back and Medb could not reproach him any more.

ut she cast about to find some other way of vanuishing Cuchulainn. he
agreement made had been that only one man a day should be sent against
him. ut now Medb sent the wizard Calatin with his twentyseven sons and
his grandson all at once, for she said â€they are really only one, for
they are all from Calatinâ€s bodyâ€. hey never missed a throw with their
poisoned spears, and every man they hit died, either on the spot or
within the week. When ergus heard of this, he was in great grief, and
he sent a man called iacha, an exile, like himself, from lster, to
watch the fight and report how it went. ow iacha did not mean to oin
in it, but when he saw Cuchulainn assailed by twentynine at a time, and
overpowered, he could not restrain himself. o he drew his sword and
helped Cuchulainn, and, between them, they killed Calatin and his whole
family.

As a last resource, now, Medb sent for erdiad, who was the great
champion of the Iberian â€Men of omnuâ€, who had thrown in their lot with
Medb in the war for the rown ull. erdiad had been a companion and
fellowpupil of Cuchulainn with cathach, and he did not wish to fight
with him. ut Medb told him that, if he refused, her satirists should
make such lampoons on him that he would die of shame, and his name would
be a reproach for ever. he also offered him great rewards and honours,
and bound herself in six sureties to keep her promises. At last,
reluctantly, he went.

Cuchulainn saw him coming, and went out to welcome him but erdiad said
that he had not come as a friend, but to fight. ow Cuchulainn had been
erdiadâ€s unior and servingboy in cathachâ€s Island, and he begged him
by the memory of those old times to go back but erdiad said he could
not. hey fought all day, and neither had gained any advantage by
sunset. o they kissed one another, and each went back to his camp.
erdiad sent half his food and drink to Cuchulainn, and Cuchulainn sent
half his healing herbs and medicines to erdiad, and their horses were
put in the same stable, and their charioteers slept by the same fire.
And so it happened on the second day. ut at the end of the third day
they parted gloomily, knowing that on the morrow one of them must fall
and their horses were not put in the same stall that night, neither did
their charioteers sleep at the same fire. n the fourth day, Cuchulainn
succeeded in killing erdiad, by casting the gae bolg at him from
underneath. ut when he saw that he was dying, the battlefury passed
away, and he took his old companion up in his arms, and carried him
across the river on whose banks they had fought, so that he might be
with the men of lster in his death, and not with the men of Ireland.
And he wept over him, and said â€It was all a game and a sport until
erdiad came h, erdiad your death will hang over me like a cloud for
ever. Yesterday he was greater than a mountain today he is less than a
shadow.â€

y this time, Cuchulainn was so covered with wounds that he could not
bear his clothes to touch his skin, but had to hold them off with
hazelsticks, and fill the spaces in between with grass. here was not a
place on him the size of a needlepoint that had not a wound on it,
except his left hand, which held the shield.

ut ualtam, Cuchulainnâ€s reputed father, had learned what a sore plight
his son was in. â€o I hear the heaven bursting, or the sea running away,
or the earth breaking open,â€ he cried, â€or is it my sonâ€s groaning that
I hearâ€ e came to look for him, and found him covered with wounds and
blood. ut Cuchulainn would not let his father either weep for him or
try to avenge him. â€Go, rather,â€ he said to him, â€to main Macha, and
tell Conchobar that I can no longer defend lster against all the four
provinces of rin without help. ell him that there is no part of my
body on which there is not a wound, and that, if he wishes to save his
kingdom, he must make no delay.â€

ualtam mounted Cuchulainnâ€s warhorse, the â€Gray of attleâ€, and
galloped to main Macha. hree times he shouted â€Men are being killed,
women carried off, and cattle lifted in lsterâ€. wice he met with no
response. he third time, Cathbad the ruid roused himself from his
lethargy to denounce the man who was disturbing the kingâ€s sleep. In his
indignation ualtam turned away so sharply that the gray steed reared,
and struck its riderâ€s shield against his neck with such force that he
was decapitated. he startled horse then turned back into Conchobarâ€s
stronghold, and dashed through it, ualtamâ€s severed head continuing to
cry out â€Men are being killed, women carried off, and cattle lifted in
lster.â€ uch a portent was enough to rouse the most drowsy. Conchobar,
himself again, swore a great oath. â€he heavens are over us, the earth
is beneath us, and the sea circles us round, and, unless the heavens
fall, with all their stars, or the earth gives way beneath us, or the
sea bursts over the land, I will restore every cow to her stable, and
every woman to her home.â€

e sent messengers to rally lster, and they gathered, and marched on
the men of rin. And then was fought such a battle as had never been
before in Ireland. irst one side, then the other, gave way and rallied
again, until Cuchulainn heard the noise of the fight, and rose up, in
spite of all his wounds, and came to it.

e called out to ergus, reminding him how he had bound himself with an
oath to run from him when called upon to do so. o ergus ran before
Cuchulainn, and when Medbâ€s army saw their leader running they broke and
fled like one man.

ut the rown ull of Cualgne went with the army into Connaught, and
there he met Ailillâ€s bull, the Whitehorned. And he fought the
Whitehorned, and tore him limb from limb, and carried off pieces of him
on his horns, dropping the loins at Athlone and the liver at rim. hen
he went back to Cualgne, and turned mad, killing all who crossed his
path, until his heart burst with bellowing, and he fell dead.

his was the end of the great war called in  Chuailgn, the
â€riving of the Cattle of Cooleyâ€.

Yet, wondrous as it was, it was not the most marvellous of Cuchulainnâ€s
exploits. ike all the solar gods and heroes of Celtic myth, he carried
his conuests into the dark region of ades. n this occasion the
mysterious realm is an island called n caith, that is, the â€hadowy
ownâ€, and though its king is not mentioned by name, it seems likely
that he was Mider, and that n caith is another name for the Isle of
alga, or Man. he story, as a poem20 relates it, is curiously
suggestive of a raid which the powers of light, and especially the
sungods, are represented as having made upon ades in kindred ritish
myth.20 he same loathsome combatants issue out of the underworld to
repel its assailants. here was a pit in the centre of n caith, out
of which swarmed a vast throng of serpents. o sooner had Cuchulainn and
the heroes of lster disposed of these than â€a house full of toadsâ€ was
loosed upon themâ€”â€sharp, beaked monstersâ€ says the poem, which caught
them by the noses, and these were in turn replaced by fierce dragons.
Yet the heroes prevailed and carried off the spoilâ€”three cows of magic
ualities and a marvellous cauldron in which was always found an
inexhaustible supply of meat, with treasure of silver and gold to boot.
hey started back for Ireland in a coracle, the three cows being towed
behind, with the treasure in bags around their necks. ut the gods of
ades raised a storm which wrecked their ship, and they had to swim
home. ere Cuchulainnâ€s more than mortal prowess came in useful. We are
told that he floated nine men to shore on each of his hands, and thirty
on his head, while eight more, clinging to his sides, used him as a kind
of lifebelt.

After this, came the tragedy of Cuchulainnâ€s career, the unhappy duel in
which he killed his only son, not knowing who he was. he story is one
common, apparently, to the Aryan nations, for it is found not only in
the Gaelic, but in the eutonic and ersian mythic traditions. It will
be remembered that Cuchulainn defeated a rival of cathach the Amazon,
named Aoife, and compelled her to render submission. he hero had also a
son by Aoife, and he asked that the boy should be called Conlaoch2,
and that, when he was of age to travel, he should be sent to Ireland to
find his father. Aoife promised this, but, a little later, news came to
her that Cuchulainn had married mer. Mad with ealousy, she determined
to make the son avenge her slight upon the father. he taught him the
craft of arms until there was no more that he could learn, and sent him
to Ireland. efore he started, she laid three geasa22 upon him. he
first was that he was not to turn back, the second that he was never to
refuse a challenge, and the third that he was never to tell his name.

e arrived at undealgan2, Cuchulainnâ€s home, and the warrior Conall
came down to meet him, and asked him his name and lineage. e refused to
tell them, and this led to a duel, in which Conall was disarmed and
humiliated. Cuchulainn next approached him, asked the same uestion, and
received the same answer. â€Yet if I was not under a command,â€ said
Conlaoch, who did not know he was speaking to his father, â€there is no
man in the world to whom I would sooner tell it than to yourself, for I
love your face.â€ ven this compliment could not stave off the fight, for
Cuchulainn felt it his duty to punish the insolence of this stripling
who refused to declare who he was. he fight was a fierce one, and the
invincible Cuchulainn found himself so pressed that the â€herolightâ€
shone round him and transfigured his face. When Conlaoch saw this, he
knew who his antagonist must be, and purposely flung his spear slantways
that it might not hit his father. ut before Cuchulainn understood, he
had thrown the terrible gae bolg. Conlaoch, dying, declared his name
and so passionate was Cuchulainnâ€s grief that the men of lster were
afraid that in his madness he might wreak his wrath upon them. hey,
therefore, called upon Cathbad the ruid to put him under a glamour.
Cathbad turned the waves of the sea into the appearance of armed men,
and Cuchulainn smote them with his sword until he fell prone from
weariness.

It would take too long to relate all the other adventures and exploits
of Cuchulainn. nough has been done if any reader of this chapter should
be persuaded by it to study the wonderful saga of ancient Ireland for
himself. We must pass on uickly to its tragical closeâ€”the heroâ€s death.

Medb, ueen of Connaught, had never forgiven him for keeping back her
army from raiding lster, and for slaying so many of her friends and
allies. o she went secretly to all those whose relations Cuchulainn had
killed and they were many, and stirred them up to revenge.

esides this, she had sent the three daughters of Calatin the Wizard,
born after their fatherâ€s death at the hands of Cuchulainn, to Alba and
to abylon to learn witchcraft. When they came back they were mistresses
of every kind of sorcery, and could make the illusion of battle with an
incantation.

And, lest she might fail even then, she waited with patience until the
ltonians were again in their magic weakness, and there was no one to
help Cuchulainn but himself.

ugaid2, son of the Curoi, ing of Munster whom Cuchulainn had
killed for the sake of lathnat, Miderâ€s daughter, gathered the Munster
men rc, whose father had also fallen at Cuchulainnâ€s hands, called the
men of Meath the ing of einster brought out his army and, with
Ailill and Medb and all Connaught, they marched into lster again, and
began to ravage it.

Conchobar called his warriors and druids into council, to see if they
could find some means of putting off war until they were ready to meet
it. e did not wish Cuchulainn to go out singlehanded a second time
against all the rest of Ireland, for he knew that, if the champion
perished, the prosperity of lster would fall with him for ever. o,
when Cuchulainn came to main Macha, the king set all the ladies,
singers, and poets of the court to keep his thoughts from war until the
men of lster had recovered from their weakness.

ut while they sat feasting and talking in the â€sunny houseâ€, the three
daughters of Calatin came fluttering down on to the lawn before it, and
began gathering grass and thistles and puffballs and withered leaves,
and turning them into the semblance of armies. And, by the same magic,
they caused shouts and shrieks and trumpetblasts and the clattering of
arms to be heard all round the house, as though a battle were being
fought.

Cuchulainn leaped up, red with shame to think that fighting should be
going on without his help, and seized his sword. ut Cathbadâ€s son
caught him by the arms. All the druids explained to him that what he saw
was only an enchantment raised by the children of Calatin to draw him
out to his death. ut it was as much as all of them could do to keep him
uiet while he saw the phantom armies and heard the magic sounds.

o they decided that it would be well to remove Cuchulainn from main
Macha to Gleannaodhar2, the â€eaf alleyâ€, until all the
enchantments of the daughters of Calatin were spent. It was the uality
of this valley that, if all the men of Ireland were to shout round it at
once, no one within it would hear a sound.

ut the daughters of Calatin went there too, and again they took
thistles and puffballs and withered leaves, and put on them the
appearance of armed men so that there seemed to be no place outside the
whole valley that was not filled with shouting battalions. And they made
the illusion of fires all around and the sound of women shrieking.
veryone who heard that outcry was frightened at it, not only the men
and women, but even the dogs.

hough the women and the druids shouted back with all the strength of
their voices, to drown it, they could not keep Cuchulainn from hearing.
â€Alasâ€ he cried, â€I hear the men of Ireland shouting as they ravage the
province. My triumph is at an end my fame is gone lster lies low for
ever.â€ â€et it pass,â€ said Cathbad â€it is only the idle magic noises
made by the children of Calatin, who want to draw you out, to put an end
to you. tay here with us, and take no heed of them.â€

Cuchulainn obeyed and the daughters of Calatin went on for a long time
filling the air with noises of battle. ut they grew tired of it at
last for they saw that the druids and women had outwitted them.

hey did not succeed until one of them took the form of a leman of
Cuchulainnâ€s, and came to him, crying out that undealgan was burnt, and
Muirthemne ruined, and the whole province of lster ravaged. hen, at
last, he was deceived, and took his arms and armour, and, in spite of
all that was said to him, he ordered aeg to yoke his chariot.

igns and portents now began to gather as thickly round the doomed hero
as they did round the wooers in the hall of dysseus. is famous
warhorse, the Gray of Macha, refused to be bridled, and shed large
tears of blood. is mother, echtir, brought him a goblet full of wine,
and thrice the wine turned into blood as he put it to his lips. At the
first ford he crossed, he saw a maiden of the sdhe washing clothes
and armour, and she told him that it was the clothes and arms of
Cuchulainn, who was soon to be dead. e met three ancient hags cooking a
hound on spits of rowan, and they invited him to partake of it. e
refused, for it was taboo to him to eat the flesh of his namesake but
they shamed him into doing so by telling him that he ate at rich menâ€s
tables and refused the hospitality of the poor. he forbidden meat
paralysed half his body. hen he saw his enemies coming up against him
in their chariots.

Cuchulainn had three spears, of which it was prophesied that each should
kill a king. hree druids were charged in turn to ask for these spears
for it was not thought lucky to refuse anything to a druid. he first
one came up to where Cuchulainn was making the plain red with slaughter.
â€Give me one of those spears,â€ he said, â€or I will lampoon you.â€ â€ake
it,â€ replied Cuchulainn, â€I have never yet been lampooned for refusing
anyone a gift.â€ And he threw the spear at the druid, and killed him. ut
ugaid, son of Curoi, got the spear, and killed aeg with it. aeg was
the king of all chariotdrivers.

â€Give me one of your spears, Cuchulainn,â€ said the second druid. â€I need
it myself,â€ he replied. â€I will lampoon the province of lster because
of you, if you refuse.â€ â€I am not obliged to give more than one gift in
a day,â€ said Cuchulainn, â€but lster shall never be lampooned because of
me.â€ e threw the spear at the druid, and it went through his head. ut
rc, ing of einster, got it, and mortally wounded the Gray of Macha,
the king of all horses.

â€Give me your spear,â€ said the third druid. â€I have paid all that is due
from myself and lster,â€ replied Cuchulainn. â€I will satirize your
kindred if you do not,â€ said the druid. â€I shall never go home, but I
will be the cause of no lampoons there,â€ answered Cuchulainn, and he
threw the spear at the asker, and killed him. ut ugaid threw it back,
and it went through Cuchulainnâ€s body, and wounded him to the death.

hen, in his agony, he greatly desired to drink. e asked his enemies to
let him go to a lake that lay close by, and uench his thirst, and then
come back again. â€If I cannot come back to you, come to fetch me,â€ he
said and they let him go.

Cuchulainn drank, and bathed, and came out of the water. ut he found
that he could not walk so he called to his enemies to come to him.
here was a pillarstone near and he bound himself to it with his belt,
so that he might die standing up, and not lying down. is dying horse,
the Gray of Macha, came back to fight for him, and killed fifty men with
his teeth and thirty with each of his hoofs. ut the â€herolightâ€ had
died out of Cuchulainnâ€s face, leaving it as pale as â€a onenightâ€s
snowâ€, and a crow came and perched upon his shoulder.

â€ruly it was not upon that pillar that birds used to sit,â€ said rc.

ow that they were certain that Cuchulainn was dead, they all gathered
round him, and ugaid cut off his head to take it to Medb. ut vengeance
came uickly, for Conall the ictorious was in pursuit, and he made a
terrible slaughter of Cuchulainnâ€s enemies.

hus perished the great hero of the Gaels in the twentyseventh year of
his age. And with him fell the prosperity of main Macha and of the ed
ranch of lster.

                        M GAIC I


he heroic age of Ireland was not, however, the mere orgy of battle
which one might assume from the previous chapter. It had room for its
elen and its Andromache as well as for its Achilles and its ector. Its
champions could find time to make love as well as war. More than this,
the legends of their courtships often have a romantic beauty found in no
other early literature. he women have free scope of choice, and claim
the respect of their wooers. Indeed, it has been pointed out that the
mythical stories of the Celts must have created the chivalrous romances
of medival urope. In them, and in no other previous literature, do we
find such knightly treatment of an enemy as we see in the story of
Cuchulainn and erdiad, or such poetic delicacy towards a woman as is
displayed in the wooing of mer.2 he talk between man and maid when
Cuchulainn comes in his chariot to pay his suit to mer at orgallâ€s
dn might, save for its strangeness, almost have come out of some
uite modern romance.

â€mer lifted up her lovely face and recognised Cuchulainn, and she said,
â€May God make smooth the path before youâ€

â€â€And you,â€ he said, â€may you be safe from every harm.â€â€

he asks him whence he has come, and he tells her. hen he uestions her
about herself.

â€I am a ara of women,â€ she replies, â€the whitest of maidens, one who is
gazed at but who gazes not back, a rush too far to be reached, an
untrodden way.... I was brought up in ancient virtues, in lawful
behaviour, in the keeping of chastity, in rank eual to a ueen, in
stateliness of form, so that to me is attributed every noble grace among
the hosts of rinâ€s women.â€ In more boastful strain Cuchulainn tells of
his own birth and deeds. ot like the son of a peasant had he been
reared at Conchobarâ€s court, but among heroes and champions, esters and
druids. When he is weakest his strength is that of twenty alone he will
fight against forty a hundred men would feel safe under his protection.
ne can imagine merâ€s smile as she listens to these braggings. â€ruly,â€
she says, â€they are goodly feats for a tender boy, but they are not yet
those of chariotchiefs.â€ ery modern, too, is the way in which she
coyly reminds her wooer that she has an elder sister as yet unwed. ut,
when at last he drives her to the point, she answers him with gentle,
but proud decision. ot by words, but by deeds is she to be won. he man
she will marry must have his name mentioned wherever the exploits of
heroes are spoken of.

â€ven as thou hast commanded, so shall all by me be done,â€ said
Cuchulainn.

â€And by me your offer is accepted, it is taken, it is granted,â€ replied
mer.

It seems a pity that, after so fine a wooing, Cuchulainn could not have
kept faithful to the bride he won. Yet such is not the way of heroes
whom goddesses as well as mortal women conspire to tempt from their
loyalty. and, the wife of Manannn son of r, deserted by the seagod,
sent her sister iban to Cuchulainn as an ambassador of love. At first
he refused to visit her, but ordered aeg, his charioteer, to go with
iban to the â€appy lainâ€ to spy out the land. aeg returned
enraptured. â€If all Ireland were mine,â€ he assured his master, â€with
supreme rule over its fair inhabitants, I would give it up without
regret to go and live in the place that I have seen.â€

o Cuchulainn himself went and stayed a month in the Celtic aradise
with and, the fairest woman of the dhe. eturning to the land of
mortals, he made a tryst with the goddess to meet him again in his own
country by the yewtree at the head of aileâ€s strand.

ut mer came to hear of it, and went to the meetingplace herself, with
fifty of her maidens, each armed with a knife to kill her rival. here
she found Cuchulainn, aeg, and and.

â€What has led you, Cuchulainn,â€ said mer, â€to shame me before the women
of rin and all honourable people I came under your shelter, trusting
in your faithfulness, and now you seek a cause of uarrel with me.â€

ut Cuchulainn, herolike, could not understand why his wife should not
be content to take her turn with this other womanâ€”surely no unworthy
rival, for she was beautiful, and came of the lofty race of gods. We see
mer yield at last, with ueenly pathos.

â€I will not refuse this woman to you, if you long for her,â€ she said,
â€for I know that everything that is new seems fair, and everything that
is common seems bitter, and everything we have not seems desirable to
us, and everything we have we think little of. And yet, Cuchulainn, I
was once pleasing to you, and I would wish to be so again.â€

er grief touched him. â€y my word,â€ he said, â€you are pleasing to me,
and will be as long as I live.â€

â€hen let me be given up,â€ said and. â€It is better that I should be,â€
replied mer. â€o,â€ said and â€it is I who must be given up in the end.

â€It is I who will go, though I go with great sorrow. I would rather stay
with Cuchulainn than live in the sunny home of the gods.

â€ mer, he is yours, and you are worthy of him What my hand cannot
have, my heart may yet wish well to.

â€A sorrowful thing it is to love without return. etter to renounce than
not to receive a love eual to oneâ€s own.

â€It was not well of you,  fairhaired mer, to come to kill and in her
misery.â€

It was while the goddess and the human woman were contending with one
another in selfsacrifice that Manannn, on of the ea, heard of andâ€s
trouble, and was sorry that he had forsaken her. o he came, invisible
to all but her alone. e asked her pardon, and she herself could not
forget that she had once been happy with the â€horseman of the crested
wavesâ€, and still might be happy with him again. he god asked her to
make her choice between them, and, when she went to him, he shook his
mantle between her and Cuchulainn. It was one of the magic properties of
Manannnâ€s mantle that those between whom it was shaken could never meet
again. hen and returned with her divine husband to the country of the
immortals and the druids of main Macha gave Cuchulainn and mer each a
drink of oblivion, so that Cuchulainn forgot his love and mer her
ealousy.2

he scene of this story takes its name from another, and hardly less
beautiful lovetale. he â€yewtree at the head of aileâ€s strandâ€ had
grown out of the grave of aile of the oneyed peech, and it bore the
appearance of aileâ€s love, Ailinn. his Gaelic omeo and uliet were of
royal birth aile was heir to lster, and Ailinn was daughter of the
ing of einsterâ€s son. ot by any feud of Montague and Capulet were
they parted, however, but by the craft of a ghostly enemy. hey had
appointed to meet one another at undealgan, and aile, who arrived
there first, was greeted by a stranger. â€What news do you bringâ€ asked
aile. â€one,â€ replied the stranger, â€except that Ailinn of einster was
setting out to meet her lover, but the men of einster kept her back,
and her heart broke then and there from grief.â€ When aile heard this,
his own heart broke, and he fell dead on the strand, while the messenger
went on the wings of the wind to the home of Ailinn, who had not yet
started. â€Whence come youâ€ she asked him. â€rom lster, by the shore of
undealgan, where I saw men raising a stone over one who had ust died,
and on the stone I read the name of aile. e had come to meet some
woman he was in love with, but it was destined that they should never
see one another again in life.â€ At this news Ailinn, too, fell dead, and
was buried and we are told that an appletree grew out of her grave,
the apples of which bore the likeness of the face of aile, while a
yewtree sprung from aileâ€s grave, and took the appearance of Ailinn.
his legend, which is probably a part of the common heritage of the
Aryans, is found in folklore over an area which stretches from Ireland
to India. he Gaelic version has, however, an ending unknown to the
others. he two trees, it relates, were cut down, and made into wands
upon which the poets of lster and of einster cut the songs of the
lovetragedies of their two provinces, in ogam. ut even these mute
memorials of aile and Ailinn were destined not to be divided. After two
hundred years, Art the â€onelyâ€, ighing of Ireland, ordered them to
be brought to the hall of ara, and, as soon as the wands found
themselves under the same roof, they all sprang together, and no force
or skill could part them again. o the king commanded them to be â€kept,
like any other ewel, in the treasury of ara.â€2

either of these stories, however, has as yet attained the fame of one
now to be retold.2 o many, no doubt, Gaelic romance is summed up in
the one word eirdre. It is the legend of this Gaelic elen that the
poets of the modern Celtic school most love to elaborate, while old men
still tell it round the peatfires of Ireland and the ighlands. cholar
and peasant alike combine to preserve a tradition no one knows how many
hundred years old, for it was written down in the twelfthcentury ook
of einster as one of the â€prime storiesâ€ which every bard was bound to
be able to recite. It takes rank with the â€ate of the ons of uirennâ€,
and with the â€ate of the Children of râ€, as one of the â€hree
orrowful tories of rinâ€.

o favourite a tale has naturally been much altered and added to in its
passage down the generations. ut its essential story is as followsâ€”

ing Conchobar of lster was holding festival in the house of one of his
bards, called edlimid, when edlimidâ€s wife gave birth to a daughter,
concerning whom Cathbad the ruid uttered a prophecy. e foretold that
the newborn child would grow up to be the most lovely woman the world
had ever seen, but that her beauty would bring death to many heroes, and
much peril and sorrow to lster. n hearing this, the ed ranch
warriors demanded that she should be killed, but Conchobar refused, and
gave the infant to a trusted servingwoman, to be hidden in a secret
place in the solitude of the mountains, until she was of an age to be
his own wife.

o eirdre as Cathbad named her was taken away to a hut so remote from
the paths of men that none knew of it save Conchobar. ere she was
brought up by a nurse, a fosterer, and a teacher, and saw no other
living creatures save the beasts and birds of the hills. evertheless,
womanlike, she aspired to be loved.

ne day, her fosterer was killing a calf for their food, and its blood
ran out upon the snowy ground, which brought a black raven swooping to
the spot. â€If there were a man,â€ said eirdre, â€who had hair of the
blackness of that raven, skin of the whiteness of the snow, and cheeks
as red as the calfâ€s blood, that is the man whom I would wish to marry
me.â€

â€Indeed there is such a man,â€ replied her teacher thoughtlessly.
â€aoise220, one of the sons of snach22, heroes of the same race as
Conchobar the ing.â€

he curious eirdre prevailed upon her teacher to bring aoise to speak
with her. When they met she made good use of her time, for she offered
aoise her love, and begged him to take her away from ing Conchobar.

aoise, bewitched by her beauty, consented. Accompanied by his two
brothers, Ardan and Ainle, and their followers, he fled with eirdre to
Alba, where they made alliance with one of its kings, and wandered over
the land, living by following the deer, and by helping the king in his
battles.

he revengeful Conchobar bided his time. ne day, as the heroes of the
ed ranch feasted together at main Macha, he asked them if they had
ever heard of a nobler company than their own. hey replied that the
world could not hold such another. â€Yetâ€, said the king, â€we lack our
full tale. he three sons of snach could defend the province of lster
against any other province of Ireland by themselves, and it is a pity
that they should still be exiles, for the sake of any woman in the
world. Gladly would I welcome them backâ€

â€We ourselves,â€ replied the ltonians, â€would have counselled this long
ago had we dared,  ingâ€

â€hen I will send one of my three best champions to fetch them,â€ said
Conchobar. â€ither Conall the ictorious, or Cuchulainn, the son of
ualtam, or ergus, the son of oy and I will find out which of those
three loves me best.â€

irst he called Conall to him secretly.

â€What would you do,  Conall,â€ he asked, â€if you were sent to fetch the
sons of snach, and they were killed here, in spite of your
safeconductâ€

â€here is not a man in lster,â€ answered Conall, â€who had hand in it
that would escape his own death from me.â€

â€I see that I am not dearest of all men to you,â€ replied Conchobar, and,
dismissing Conall, he called Cuchulainn, and put the same uestion to
him.

â€y my sworn word,â€ replied Cuchulainn, â€if such a thing happened with
your consent, no bribe or bloodfine would I accept in lieu of your own
head,  Conchobar.â€

â€ruly,â€ said the king, â€it is not you I will send.â€

he king then asked ergus, and he replied that, if the sons of snach
were slain while under his protection, he would revenge the deed upon
anyone who was party to it, save only the king himself.

â€hen it is you who shall go,â€ said Conchobar. â€et forth tomorrow, and
rest not by the way, and when you put foot again in Ireland at the n
of orrach, whatever may happen to you yourself, send the sons of snach
forward without delay.â€

he next morning, ergus, with his two sons, Illann the air and uinne
the uthless ed, set out for Alba in their galley, and reached och
tive, by whose shores the sons of snach were then living. aoise,
Ainle, and Ardan were sitting at chess when they heard ergusâ€s shout.

â€hat is the cry of a man of rin,â€ said aoise.

â€ay,â€ replied eirdre, who had forebodings of trouble. â€o not heed it
it is only the shout of a man of Alba.â€ ut the sons of snach knew
better, and sent Ardan down to the seashore, where he found ergus and
his sons, and gave them greeting, and heard their message, and brought
them back with him.

hat night ergus persuaded the sons of snach to return with him to
main Macha. eirdre, with her â€second sightâ€, implored them to remain
in Alba. ut the exiles were weary for the sight of their own country,
and did not share their companionâ€s fears. As they put out to sea,
eirdre uttered her beautiful â€arewell to Albaâ€, that land she was
never to behold again.

           â€A lovable land is yon eastern land,
            Alba, with its marvels.
            I would not have come hither out of it,
            ad I not come with aoise.

           â€ovable are nfidga and nfinn,
            ovable the fortress over them
            ear to the heart Inis raigende,
            And very dear is n uibni.

           â€Caill Cuan
            nto which Ainle would wend, alas
            hort the time seemed to me,
            With aoise in the region of Alba.

           â€Glenn id
            ften I slept there under the cliff
            ish and venison and the fat of the badger
            Was my portion in Glenn id.

           â€Glenn Masin
            Its garlic was tall, its branches white
            We slept a rocking sleep,
            ver the grassy estuary of Masin.

           â€Glenn tive
            Where my first house I raised
            eauteous its woodâ€”upon rising
            A cattlefold for the sun was Glenn tive.

                                                   

           â€Glenn ad
            My love to every man who hath it as an heritage
            weet the cuckoosâ€ note on bending bough,
            n the peak over Glenn ad.

           â€eloved is raigen,
            ear the white sand beneath its waves
            I would not have come from it, from the ast,
            ad I not come with my beloved.â€

hey crossed the sea, and arrived at the n of orrach, who bade them
welcome to Ireland. ow ing Conchobar had sent orrach a secret
command, that he should offer a feast to ergus on his landing. trange
taboos called geasa are laid upon the various heroes of ancient
Ireland in the stories there are certain things that each one of them
may not do without forfeiting life or honour and it was a geis upon
ergus to refuse a feast.

ergus, we are told, â€reddened with anger from crown to soleâ€ at the
invitation. Yet he could not avoid the feast. e asked aoise what he
should do, and eirdre broke in with â€o what is asked of you if you
prefer to forsake the sons of snach for a feast. Yet forsaking them is
a good price to pay for it.â€

ergus, however, perceived a possible compromise. hough he himself
could not refuse to stop to partake of orrachâ€s hospitality, he could
send eirdre and the sons of snach on to main Macha at once, under the
safeguard of his two sons, Illann the air and uinne the uthless ed.
o this was done, albeit to the annoyance of the sons of snach and the
terror of eirdre. isions came to the sorrowful woman she saw the
three sons of snach and Illann, the son of ergus, without their heads
she saw a cloud of blood always hanging over them. he begged them to
wait in some safe place until ergus had finished the feast. ut aoise,
Ainle, and Ardan laughed at her fears. hey arrived at main Macha, and
Conchobar ordered the â€ed ranchâ€ palace to be placed at their
disposal.

In the evening Conchobar called evarcham, eirdreâ€s old teacher, to
him. â€Goâ€, he said, â€to the â€ed ranchâ€, and see eirdre, and bring me
back news of her appearance, whether she still keeps her former beauty,
or whether it has left her.â€

o evarcham came to the â€ed ranchâ€, and kissed eirdre and the three
sons of snach, and warned them that Conchobar was preparing treachery.
hen she went back to the king, and reported to him that eirdreâ€s hard
life upon the mountains of Alba had ruined her form and face, so that
she was no longer worthy of his regard.

At this, Conchobarâ€s ealousy was partly allayed, and he began to doubt
whether it would be wise to attack the sons of snach. ut later on,
when he had drunk well of wine, he sent a second messenger to see if
what evarcham had reported about eirdre was truth.

he messenger, this time a man, went and looked in through a window.
eirdre saw him and pointed him out to aoise, who flung a chessman at
the peering face, and put out one of its eyes. ut the man went back to
Conchobar, and told him that, though one of his eyes had been struck
out, he would gladly have stayed looking with the other, so great was
eirdreâ€s loveliness.

hen Conchobar, in his wrath, ordered the men of lster to set fire to
the ed ranch ouse and slay all within it except eirdre. hey flung
firebrands upon it, but uinne the uthless ed came out and uenched
them, and drove the assailants back with slaughter. ut Conchobar called
to him to parley, and offered him a â€hundredâ€ of land and his friendship
to desert the sons of snach. uinne was tempted, and fell but the land
given him turned barren that very night in indignation at being owned by
such a traitor.

he other of ergusâ€s sons was of different make. e charged out, torch
in hand, and cut down the ltonians, so that they hesitated to come near
the house again. Conchobar dared not offer him a bribe. ut he armed his
own son, iacha, with his own magic weapons, including his shield, the
â€Moanerâ€, which roared when its owner was in danger, and sent him to
fight Illann.

he duel was a fierce one, and Illann got the better of iacha, so that
the son of Conchobar had to crouch down beneath his shield, which roared
for help. Conall the ictorious heard the roar from far off, and thought
that his king must be in peril. e came to the place, and, without
asking uestions, thrust his spear â€luegreenâ€ through Illann. he
dying son of ergus explained the situation to Conall, who, by way of
making some amends, at once killed iacha as well.

After this, the sons of snach held their fort till dawn against all
Conchobarâ€s host. ut, with day, they saw that they must either escape
or resign themselves to perish. utting eirdre in their centre,
protected by their shields, they opened the door suddenly and fled out.

hey would have broken through and escaped, had not Conchobar asked
Cathbad the ruid to put a spell upon them, promising to spare their
lives. o Cathbad raised the illusion of a stormy sea before and all
around the sons of snach. aoise lifted eirdre upon his shoulder, but
the magic waves rose higher, until they were all obliged to fling away
their weapons and swim.

hen was seen the strange sight of men swimming upon dry land. And,
before the glamour passed away, the sons of snach were seized from
behind, and brought to Conchobar.

In spite of his promise to the druid, the king condemned them to death.
one of the men of lster would, however, deal the blow. In the end, a
foreigner from orway, whose father aoise had slain, offered to behead
them. ach of the brothers begged to die first, that he might not
witness the deaths of the others. ut aoise ended this noble rivalry by
lending their executioner the sword called â€he etaliatorâ€, which had
been given him by Manannn son of r. hey knelt down side by side, and
one blow of the sword of the god shore off all their heads.

As for eirdre, there are varying stories of her death, but most of them
agree that she did not survive the sons of snach many hours. ut,
before she died, she made an elegy over them. hat it is of a singular
pathos and beauty the few verses which there is space to give will
show.222

          â€ong the day without snachâ€s children
           It was not mournful to be in their company
           ons of a king by whom soourners were entertained,
           hree lions from the ill of the Cave.

                                                  

          â€hree darlings of the women of ritain,
           hree hawks of lieve Gullion,
           ons of a king whom valour served,
           o whom soldiers used to give homage

                                                  

          â€hat I should remain after aoise
           et no one in the world suppose
           After Ardan and Ainle
           My time would not be long.

          â€lsterâ€s overking, my first husband,
           I forsook for aoiseâ€s love.
           hort my life after them
           I will perform their funeral game.

          â€After them I shall not be aliveâ€”
           hree that would go into every conflict,
           hree who liked to endure hardships,
           hree heroes who refused not combats.

                                                  

          â€ man, that diggest the tomb
           And puttest my darling from me,
           Make not the grave too narrow
           I shall be beside the noble ones.â€

It was a poor triumph for Conchobar. eirdre in all her beauty had
escaped him by death. is own chief followers never forgave it. ergus,
when he returned from orrachâ€s feast, and found out what had been done,
gathered his own people, slew Conchobarâ€s son and many of his warriors,
and fled to lsterâ€s bitterest enemies, Ailill and Medb of Connaught.
And Cathbad the ruid cursed both king and kingdom, praying that none of
Conchobarâ€s race might ever reign in main Macha again.

o it came to pass. he capital of lster was only kept from ruin by
Cuchulainnâ€s prowess. When he perished, it also fell, and soon became
what it is nowâ€”a grassy hill.

                              CA I

                       I A  IA22


he epoch of main Macha is followed in the annals of ancient Ireland by
a succession of monarchs who, though doubtless as mythical as ing
Conchobar and his court, seem to grow gradually more human. heir line
lasts for about two centuries, culminating in a dynasty with which
legend has occupied itself more than with its immediate predecessors.
his is the one which began, according to the annalists, in A.. ,
with the famous Conn â€the undredighterâ€, and, passing down to the
reign of his even more famous grandson, Cormac â€the Magnificentâ€, is
connected with the third Gaelic cycleâ€”that which relates the exploits of
inn and the enians. All these kings had their dealings with the
national gods. A story contained in a fifteenthcentury Irish
manuscript, and called â€he Championâ€s rophecyâ€,22 tells how ugh
appeared to Conn, enveloped him in a magic mist, led him away to an
enchanted palace, and there prophesied to him the number of his
descendants, the length of their reigns, and the manner of their deaths.
Another tradition relates how Connâ€s son, Connla, was wooed by a goddess
and borne away, like the ritish Arthur, in a boat of glass to the
arthly aradise beyond the sea.22 Yet another relates Connâ€s own
marriage with ecuma of the air kin, wife of that same abraid of the
uick and on word who, in another legend, married iban, the sister of
and, Cuchulainnâ€s fairy love. ecuma had been discovered in an intrigue
with Gaiar, a son of Manannn, and, banished from the â€and of romiseâ€,
crossed the sea that sunders mortals and immortals to offer her hand to
Conn. he Irish king wedded her, but evil came of the marriage. he grew
ealous of Connâ€s other son, Art, and insisted upon his banishment but
they agreed to play chess to decide which should go, and Art won. Art,
called â€the onelyâ€ because he had lost his brother Connla, was king
after Conn, but he is chiefly known to legend as the father of Cormac.

Many Irish stories occupy themselves with the fame of Cormac, who is
pictured as a great legislatorâ€”a Gaelic olomon. Certain traditions
credit him with having been the first to believe in a purer doctrine
than the Celtic polytheism, and even with having attempted to put down
druidism, in revenge for which a druid called Maelcen sent an evil
spirit who placed a salmonbone crossways in the kingâ€s throat, as he
sat at meat, and so compassed his death. Another class of stories,
however, make him an especial favourite with those same heathen deities.
Manannn son of r, was so anxious for his friendship that he decoyed
him into fairyland, and gave him a magic branch. It was of silver, and
bore golden apples, and, when it was shaken, it made such sweet music
that the wounded, the sick, and the sorrowful forgot their pains, and
were lulled into deep sleep. Cormac kept this treasure all his life
but, at his death, it returned into the hands of the gods.22

ing Cormac was a contemporary of inn mac Coul22, whom he appointed
head of the ianna22 irinn, more generally known as the â€eniansâ€.
Around inn and his men have gathered a cycle of legends which were
eually popular with the Gaels of both cotland and Ireland. We read of
their exploits in stories and poems preserved in the earliest Irish
manuscripts, while among the peasantry both of Ireland and of the West
ighlands their names and the stories connected with them are still
current lore. pon some of these floating traditions, as preserved in
folk ballads, Macherson founded his factitious ssian, and the
collection of them from the lips of living men still affords plenty of
employment to Gaelic students.

ow far inn and his followers may have been historical personages it is
impossible to say. he Irish people themselves have always held that the
enians were a kind of native militia, and that inn was their general.
he early historical writers of Ireland supported this view. he
chronicler ighernach, who died in 0, believed in him, and the
â€Annals of the our Mastersâ€, compiled between the years 2 and 
from older chronicles, while they ignore ing Conchobar and his ed
ranch Champions as unworthy of the serious consideration of historians,
treat inn as a real person whose death took place in 2 A.. ven so
great a modern scholar as ugene â€Curry declared in the clearest
language that inn, so far from being â€a merely imaginary or mythical
characterâ€, was â€an undoubtedly historical personage and that he
existed about the time at which his appearance is recorded in the Annals
is as certain as that ulius Caesar lived and ruled at the time stated
on the authority of the oman historiansâ€.22

he opinion of more recent Celtic scholars, however, is opposed to this
view. innâ€s pedigree, preserved in the ook of einster, may seem at
first to give some support to the theory of his real existence, but, on
more careful examination of it, his own name and that of his father
eually bewray him. inn or ionn, meaning â€fairâ€, is the name of one of
the mythical ancestors of the Gaels, while his fatherâ€s name,
Cumhal20, signifies the â€skyâ€, and is the same word as Camulus, the
Gaulish heavengod identified by the omans with Mars. is followers are
as doubtfully human as himself. ne may compare them with Cuchulainn and
the rest of the heroes of main Macha. heir deeds are not less
marvellous. ike the ltonian warriors, they move, too, on eual terms
with the gods. â€he ianna of rinâ€, says a tract called â€he ialogue
of the ldersâ€,2 contained in thirteenth and fourteenth century
manuscripts, â€had not more freuent and free intercourse with the men of
settled habitation than with the uatha  anannâ€.22 Angus, Mider,
r, Manannn, and odb the ed, with their countless sons and
daughters, loom as large in the enian, or socalled â€ssianicâ€ stories
as do the enians themselves. hey fight for them, or against them they
marry them, and are given to them in marriage.

A luminous suggestion of rofessor hys also hints that the enians
inherited the conduct of that ancient war formerly waged between the
uatha  anann and the omors. he most common antagonists of inn and
his heroes are tribes of invaders from oversea, called in the stories
the ochlannach. hese â€Men of ochlannâ€ are usually identified, by
those who look for history in the stories of the enian cycle, with the
invading bands of orsemen who harried the Irish coasts in the ninth
century. ut the nucleus of the enian tales antedates these
candinavian raids, and mortal foes have probably merely stepped into
the place of those immortal enemies of the gods whose â€ochlannâ€ was a
country, not over the seaâ€”but under it.2

he earlier historians of Ireland were as ready with their dates and
facts regarding the enian band as an institution as with the
personality of inn. It was said to have been first organized by a king
called iachadh, in 00 .C., and abolished, or rather, exterminated, by
Cairbr, the son of Cormac mac Art, in 2 A.. We are told that it
consisted of three regiments modelled on the oman legion each of these
bodies contained, on a peace footing, three thousand men, but in time of
war could be indefinitely strengthened. Its obect was to defend the
coasts of Ireland and the country generally, throwing its weight upon
the side of any prince who happened to be assailed by foreign foes.
uring the six months of winter, its members were uartered upon the
population, but during the summer they had to forage for themselves,
which they did by hunting and fishing. hus they lived in the woods and
on the open moors, hardening themselves for battle by their adventurous
life. he sites of their enormous campfires were long pointed out under
the name of the â€eniansâ€ cookingplacesâ€.

It was not easy to become a member of this famous band. A candidate had
to be not only an expert warrior, but a poet and a man of culture as
well. e had practically to renounce his tribe at any rate he made oath
that he would neither avenge any of his relatives nor be avenged by
them. e put himself under bonds never to refuse hospitality to anyone
who asked, never to turn his back in battle, never to insult any woman,
and not to accept a dowry with his wife. In addition to all this, he had
to pass successfully through the most stringent physical tests. Indeed,
as these have come down to us, magnified by the perfervid Celtic
imagination, they are of an altogether marvellous and impossible
character. An aspirant to the ianna irinn, we are told, had first to
stand up to his knees in a pit dug for him, his only arms being his
shield and a hazel wand, while nine warriors, each with a spear,
standing within the distance of nine ridges of land, all hurled their
weapons at him at once if he failed to ward them all off, he was
reected. hould he succeed in this first test, he was given the
distance of one treelengthâ€s start, and chased through a forest by
armed men if any of them came up to him and wounded him, he could not
belong to the enians. If he escaped unhurt, but had unloosed a single
lock of his braided hair, or had broken a single branch in his flight,
or if, at the end of the run, his weapons trembled in his hands, he was
refused. As, besides these tests, he was obliged to ump over a branch
as high as his forehead, and stoop under one as low as his knee, while
running at full speed, and to pluck a thorn out of his heel without
hindrance to his flight, it is clear that even the rank and file of the
enians must have been uite exceptional athletes.2

ut it is time to pass on to a more detailed description of these
champions.2 hey are a goodly company, not less heroic than the
mighty men of lster. irst comes inn himself, not the strongest in
body of the enians, but the truest, wisest, and kindest, gentle to
women, generous to men, and trusted by all. If he could help it, he
would never let anyone be in trouble or poverty. â€If the dead leaves of
the forest had been gold, and the white foam of the water silver, inn
would have given it all away.â€

inn had two sons, ergus and his more famous brother ssian2.
ergus of the sweet speech was the enianâ€s bard, and, also, because of
his honeyed words, their diplomatist and ambassador. Yet, by the irony
of fate, it is to ssian, who is not mentioned as a poet in the earliest
texts, that the poems concerning the enians which are current in
cotland under the name of â€ssianic alladsâ€ are attributed. ssianâ€s
mother was adb, a daughter of odb the ed. A rival goddess changed her
into a deerâ€”which explains how ssian got his name, which means â€fawnâ€.
With such advantages of birth, naturally he was speedy enough to run
down a red deer hind and catch her by the ear, though far less
swiftfooted than his cousin Caoilte2, the â€hin Manâ€. either was
he so strong as his own son scar, the mightiest of all the enians,
yet, in his youth, so clumsy that the rest of the band refused to take
him with them on their warlike expeditions. hey changed their minds,
however, when, one day, he followed them unawares, found them giving way
before an enemy, and, rushing to their help, armed only with a great log
of wood which lay handy on the ground, turned the fortunes of the fight.
After this, scar was hailed the best warrior of all the ianna he was
given command of a battalion, and its banner, called the â€errible
roomâ€, was regarded as the centre of every battle, for it was never
known to retreat a foot. ther prominent enians were Goll2, son of
Morna, at first innâ€s enemy but afterwards his follower, a man skilled
alike in war and learning. ven though he was oneeyed, we are told that
he was much loved by women, but not so much as innâ€s cousin, iarmait
â€uibhne2, whose fatal beauty ensnared even innâ€s betrothed bride,
Grainne20. heir comic character was Conan, who is represented as an
old, bald, vain, irritable man, as great a braggart as ancient istol
and as foulmouthed as hersites, and yet, after he had once been shamed
into activity, a true man of his hands. hese are the prime enian
heroes, the chief actors in its stories.

he enian epic begins, before the birth of its hero, with the struggle
of two rival clans, each of whom claimed to be the real and only ianna
irinn. hey were called the Clann Morna, of which Goll mac Morna was
head, and the Clann aoisgne2, commanded by innâ€s father, Cumhal. A
battle was fought at Cnucha22, in which Goll killed Cumhal, and the
Clann aoisgne was scattered. Cumhalâ€s wife, however, bore a posthumous
son, who was brought up among the lieve loom Mountains secretly, for
fear his fatherâ€s enemies should find and kill him. he boy, who was at
first called eimne2, grew up to be an expert hurler, swimmer,
runner, and hunter. ater, like Cuchulainn, and indeed many modern
savages, he took a second, more personal name. hose who saw him asked
who was the â€fairâ€ youth. e accepted the omen, and called himself
eimne inn.

At length, he wandered to the banks of the oyne, where he found a
soothsayer called inn the eer living beside a deep pool near lane,
named â€ecâ€s oolâ€, in hope of catching one of the â€salmons of
knowledgeâ€, and, by eating it, obtaining universal wisdom. e had been
there seven years without result, though success had been prophesied to
one named â€innâ€. When the wandering son of Cumhal appeared, inn the
eer engaged him as his servant. hortly afterwards, he caught the
coveted fish, and handed it over to our inn to cook, warning him to eat
no portion of it. â€ave you eaten any of itâ€ he asked the boy, as he
brought it up ready boiled. â€o indeed,â€ replied inn â€but, while I was
cooking it, a blister rose upon the skin, and, laying my thumb down upon
the blister, I scalded it, and so I put it into my mouth to ease the
pain.â€ he man was perplexed. â€You told me your name was eimne,â€ he
said â€but have you any other nameâ€ â€Yes, I am also called inn.â€ â€It
is enough,â€ replied his disappointed master. â€at the salmon yourself,
for you must be the one of whom the prophecy told.â€ inn ate the â€salmon
of knowledgeâ€, and thereafter he had only to put his thumb under his
tooth, as he had done when he scalded it, to receive foreknowledge and
magic counsel.2

hus armed, inn was more than a match for the Clann Morna. Curious
legends tell how he discovered himself to his fatherâ€s old followers,
confounded his enemies with his magic, and turned them into faithful
servants.2 ven Goll of the lows had to submit to his sway.
Gradually he welded the two opposing clans into one ianna, over which
he ruled, taking tribute from the kings of Ireland, warring against the
omorian â€ochlannachâ€, destroying every kind of giant, serpent, or
monster that infested the land, and at last carrying his mythical
conuests over all urope.

ut of the numberless stories of the enian exploits it is hard to
choose examples. All are heroic, romantic, wild, fantastic. In many of
them the uatha  anann play prominent parts. ne such story connects
itself with an earlier mythological episode already related. he reader
will remember2 how, when the agda gave up the kingship of the
immortals, five aspirants appeared to claim it how of these fiveâ€”Angus,
Mider, r, Ilbhreach son of Manannn, and odb the edâ€”the latter was
chosen how r refused to acknowledge him, but was reconciled later
how Mider, eually rebellious, fled to â€desert country round Mount
einsterâ€ in County Carlow and how a yearly war was waged upon him and
his people by the rest of the gods to bring them to subection. his war
was still raging in the time of inn, and Mider was not too proud to
seek his help. ne day that inn was hunting in onegal, with ssian,
scar, Caoilte, and iarmait, their hounds roused a beautiful fawn,
which, although at every moment apparently nearly overtaken, led them in
full chase as far as Mount einster. ere it suddenly disappeared into a
cleft in the hillside. eavy snow, â€making the forestâ€s branches as it
were a withetwistâ€, now fell, forcing the enians to seek for some
shelter, and they therefore explored the place into which the fawn had
vanished. It led to a splendid sdh in the hollow of the hill.
ntering it, they were greeted by a beautiful goddessmaiden, who told
them that it was she, Miderâ€s daughter, who had been the fawn, and that
she had taken that shape purposely to lead them there, in the hope of
getting their help against the army that was coming to attack the
sdh. inn asked who the assailants would be, and was told that they
were odb the ed with his seven sons, Angus â€on of the Youngâ€ with his
seven sons, r of dh ionnechaidh with his twentyseven sons, and
ionnbharr of dh Meadha with his seventeen sons, as well as numberless
gods of lesser fame drawn from sdhe not only over all Ireland, but
from cotland and the islands as well. inn promised his aid, and, with
the twilight of that same day, the attacking forces appeared, and made
their annual assault. hey were beaten off, after a battle that lasted
all night, with the loss of â€ten men, ten score, and ten hundredâ€. inn,
scar, and iarmait, as well as most of Miderâ€s many sons, were sorely
wounded, but the leech abhra healed all their wounds.2

ooth to say, the enians did not always reuire the excuse of fairy
alliance to start them making war on the race of the hills. ne of the
socalled â€ssianic balladsâ€ is entitled â€he Chase of the nchanted
igs of Angus of the rugh2â€. his Angus is, of course, the â€on of
the Youngâ€, and the rugh that famous sdh beside the oyne out of
which he cheated his father, the agda. After the friendly manner of
gods towards heroes, he invited inn and a picked thousand of his
followers to a banuet at the rugh. hey came to it in their finest
clothes, â€goblets went from hand to hand, and waiters were kept in
motionâ€. At last conversation fell upon the comparative merits of the
pleasures of the table and of the chase, Angus stoutly contending that
â€the godsâ€ life of perpetual feastingâ€ was better than all the enian
huntings, and inn as stoutly denying it. inn boasted of his hounds,
and Angus said that the best of them could not kill one of his pigs.
inn angrily replied that his two hounds, ran2 and geolan20,
would kill any pig that trod on dry land. Angus answered that he could
show inn a pig that none of his hounds or huntsmen could catch or kill.
ere were the makings of a pretty uarrel among such inflammable
creatures as gods and heroes, but the steward of the feast interposed
and sent everyone to bed. he next morning, inn left the rugh, for he
did not want to fight all Angusâ€s fairies with his handful of a thousand
men. A year passed before he heard more of it then came a messenger
from Angus, reminding inn of his promise to pit his men and hounds
against Angusâ€s pigs. he enians seated themselves on the tops of the
hills, each with his favourite hound in leash, and they had not been
there long before there appeared on the eastern plain a hundred and one
such pigs as no enian had ever seen before. ach was as tall as a deer,
and blacker than a smithâ€s coals, having hair like a thicket and
bristles like shipsâ€ masts. Yet such was the prowess of the enians that
they killed them all, though each of the pigs slew ten men and many
hounds. hen Angus complained that the enians had murdered his son and
many others of the uatha  anann, who, indeed, were none other than
the pigs whose forms they had taken. here were mighty recriminations on
both sides, and, in the end, the enraged enians prepared to attack the
rugh on the oyne. hen only did Angus begin to yield, and, by the
advice of ssian, inn made peace with him and his fairy folk.

uch are specimens of the tales which go to make up the enian cycle of
sagas. unting is the most prominent feature of them, for the enians
were essentially a race of mighty hunters. ut the creatures of their
chase were not always flesh and blood. nchanters who wished the enians
ill could always lure them into danger by taking the shape of boar or
deer, and many a story begins with an innocent chase and ends with a
murderous battle. ut out of such struggles the enians always emerge
successfully, as ssian is represented proudly boasting, â€through
truthfulness and the might of their handsâ€.

he most famous chase of all is, however, not that of deer or boar, but
of a woman and a man, innâ€s betrothed wife and his nephew
iarmait.2 ver fortunate in war, the enian leader found disaster
in his love. Wishing for a wife in his old age, he sent to seek Grainne,
the daughter of Cormac, the ighing of Ireland. oth ing Cormac and
his daughter consented, and innâ€s ambassadors returned with an
invitation to the suitor to come in a fortnightâ€s time to claim his
bride. e arrived with his picked band, and was received in state in the
great banuetinghall of ara. here they feasted, and there Grainne,
the kingâ€s daughter, casting her eyes over the assembled enian heroes,
saw iarmait â€uibhne.

his enian Adonis had a beautyspot upon his cheek which no woman could
see without falling instantly in love with him. Grainne, for all her
royal birth, was no exception to this rule. he asked a druid to point
her out the principal guests. he druid told her all their names and
exploits. hen she called for a ewelled drinkinghorn, and, filling it
with a drugged wine, sent it round to each in turn, except to iarmait.
one could be so discourteous as to refuse wine from the hand of a
princess. All drank, and fell into deep sleep.

hen, rising, she came to iarmait, told him her passion for him, and
asked for its return. â€I will not love the betrothed of my chief,â€ he
replied, â€and, even if I wished, I dare not.â€ And he praised innâ€s
virtues, and decried his own fame. ut Grainne merely answered that she
put him under geasa bonds which no hero could refuse to redeem to
flee with her and at once went back to her chair before the rest of the
company awoke from their slumber.

After the feast, iarmait went round to his comrades, one by one, and
told them of Grainneâ€s love for him, and of the geasa she had placed
upon him to take her from ara. e asked each of them what he ought to
do. All answered that no hero could break a geis put upon him by a
woman. e even asked inn, concealing Grainneâ€s name, and inn gave him
the same counsel as the others. hat night, the lovers fled from ara to
the ford of the hannon at Athlone, crossed it, and came to a place
called the â€Wood of the wo entsâ€, where iarmait wove a hut of
branches for Grainne to shelter in.

Meanwhile inn had discovered their flight, and his rage knew no bounds.
e sent his trackers, the Clann eamhuain22, to follow them. hey
tracked them to the wood, and one of them climbed a tree, and, looking
down, saw the hut, with a strong sevendoored fence built round it, and
iarmait and Grainne inside. When the news came to the enians, they
were sorry, for their sympathies were with iarmait and not with inn.
hey tried to warn him, but he took no heed for he had determined to
fight and not to flee. Indeed, when inn himself came to the fence, and
called over it to iarmait, asking if he and Grainne were within, he
replied that they were, but that none should enter unless he gave
permission.

o iarmait, like Cuchulainn in the war of lster against Ireland, found
himself matched singlehanded against a host. ut, also like Cuchulainn,
he had a divine helper. he favourite of the uatha  anann, he had
been the pupil of Manannn son of r in the â€and of romiseâ€, and had
been fostered by Angus of the rugh. Manannn had given him his two
spears, the â€ed avelinâ€ and the â€Yellow avelinâ€, and his two swords,
the â€Great uryâ€ and the â€ittle uryâ€. And now Angus came to look for
his fosterson, and brought with him the magic mantle of invisibility
used by the gods. e advised iarmait and Grainne to come out wrapped in
the cloak, and thus rendered invisible. iarmait still refused to flee,
but asked Angus to protect Grainne. Wrapping the magic mantle round her,
the god led the princess away unseen by any of the enians.

y this time, inn had posted men outside all the seven doors in the
fence. iarmait went to each of them in turn. At the first, were ssian
and scar with the Clann aoisgne. hey offered him their protection. At
the second, were Caoilte and the Clann onan, who said they would fight
to the death for him. At the third, were Conan and the Clann Morna, also
his friends. At the fourth, stood Cuan with the enians of Munster,
iarmaitâ€s native province. At the fifth, were the lster enians, who
also promised him protection against inn. ut at the sixth, were the
Clann eamhuain, who hated him and at the seventh, was inn himself.

â€It is by your door that I will pass out,  inn,â€ cried iarmait. inn
charged his men to surround iarmait as he came out, and kill him. ut
he leaped the fence, passing clean over their heads, and fled away so
swiftly that they could not follow him. e never halted till he reached
the place to which he knew Angus had taken Grainne. he friendly god
left them with a little sage advice never to hide in a tree with only
one trunk never to rest in a cave with only one entrance never to land
on an island with only one channel of approach not to eat their supper
where they had cooked it, nor to sleep where they had supped, and, where
they had slept once, never to sleep again. With these edIndianlike
tactics, it was some time before inn discovered them.

owever, he found out at last where they were, and sent champions with
venomous hounds to take or kill them. ut iarmait conuered all who
were sent against him.

Yet still inn pursued, until iarmait, as a last hope of escape, took
refuge under a magic uickentree2, which bore scarlet fruit, the
ambrosia of the gods. It had grown from a single berry dropped by one of
the uatha  anann, who, when they found that they had carelessly
endowed mortals with celestial and immortal food, had sent a huge,
oneeyed omor called harvan the urly to guard it, so that no man
might eat of its fruit. All day, this omor sat at the foot of the tree,
and, all night, he slept among its branches, and so terrible was his
appearance that neither the enians nor any other people dared to come
within several miles of him.

ut iarmait was willing to brave the omor in the hope of getting a
safe hidingplace for Grainne. e came boldly up to him, and asked leave
to camp and hunt in his neighbourhood. he omor told him surlily that
he might camp and hunt where he pleased, so long as he refrained from
taking any of the scarlet berries. o iarmait built a hut near a
spring and he and Grainne lived there, killing the wild animals for
food.

ut, unhappily, Grainne conceived so strong a desire to eat the uicken
berries that she felt that she must die unless her wish could be
gratified. At first she tried to hide this longing, but in the end she
was forced to tell her companion. iarmait had no desire to uarrel with
the omor so he went to him and told the plight that Grainne was in,
and asked for a handful of the berries as a gift.

ut the omor merely answered â€I swear to you that if nothing would
save the princess and her unborn child except my berries, and if she
were the last woman upon the earth, she should not have any of them.â€
Whereupon iarmait fought the omor, and, after much trouble, killed
him.

It was reported to inn that the guardian of the magic uickentree
lived no longer, and he guessed that iarmait must have killed him so
he came down to the place with seven battalions of the enians to look
for him. y this time, iarmait had abandoned his own hut and taken
possession of that built by the omor among the branches of the magic
uicken. e was sitting in it with Grainne when inn and his men came
and camped at the foot of the tree, to wait till the heat of noon had
passed before beginning their search.

o beguile the time, inn called for his chessboard and challenged his
son ssian to a game. hey played until ssian had only one more move.

â€ne move would make you a winner,â€ said inn to him, â€but I challenge
you and all the enians to guess it.â€

nly iarmait, who had been looking down through the branches upon the
players, knew the move. e could not resist dropping a berry on to the
board, so deftly that it hit the very chessman which ssian ought to
move in order to win. ssian took the hint, moved it, and won. A second
and a third game were played and in each case the same thing happened.
hen inn felt sure that the berries that had prompted ssian must have
been thrown by iarmait.

e called out, asking iarmait if he were there, and the enian hero,
who never spoke an untruth, answered that he was. o the uickentree
was surrounded by armed men, ust as the fenced hut in the woods had
been. ut, again, things happened in the same way for Angus of the
rugh took away Grainne wrapped in the invisible magic cloak, while
iarmait, walking to the end of a thick branch, cleared the circle of
enians at a bound, and escaped untouched.

his was the end of the famous â€ursuitâ€ for Angus came as ambassador
to inn, urging him to become reconciled to the fugitives, and all the
best of the enians begged inn to consent. o iarmait and Grainne were
allowed to return in peace.

ut inn never really forgave, and, soon after, he urged iarmait to go
out to the chase of the wild boar of enn Gulban2. iarmait killed
the boar without getting any hurt for, like the Greek Achilles, he was
invulnerable, save in his heel alone. inn, who knew this, told him to
measure out the length of the skin with his bare feet. iarmait did so.
hen inn, declaring that he had measured it wrongly, ordered him to
tread it again in the opposite direction. his was against the lie of
the bristles and one of them pierced iarmaitâ€s heel, and inflicted a
poisoned and mortal wound.

his â€ursuit of iarmait and Grainneâ€, which has been told at such
length, marks in some degree the climax of the enian power, after which
it began to decline towards its end. he friends of iarmait never
forgave the treachery with which inn had compassed his death. he
everslumbering rivalry between Goll and his Clann Morna and inn and
his Clann aoisgne began to show itself as open enmity. uarrels arose,
too, between the enians and the ighings of Ireland, which culminated
at last in the annihilation of the ianna at the battle of Gabhra2.

his is said to have been fought in A.. 2. inn himself had perished
a year before it, in a skirmish with rebellious enians at the ord of
rea on the oyne. ing Cormac the Magnificent, Grainneâ€s father, was
also dead. It was between innâ€s grandson scar and Cormacâ€s son Cairbr
that war broke out. his mythical battle was as fiercely waged as that
of Arthurâ€s last fight at Camlan. scar slew Cairbr, and was slain by
him. Almost all the enians fell, as well as all Cairbrâ€s forces.

nly two of the greater enian figures survived. ne was Caoilte, whose
swiftness of foot saved him at the end when all was lost. he famous
story, called the â€ialogue of the ldersâ€, represents him discoursing
to t. atrick, centuries after, of the eniansâ€ wonderful deeds. aving
lost his friends of the heroic age, he is said to have cast in his lot
with the uatha  anann. e fought in a battle, with Ilbhreach son of
Manannn, against r himself, and killed the ancient seagod with his
own hand.2 he tale represents him taking possession of râ€s fairy
palace of dh ionnechaidh, after which we know no more of him, except
that he has taken rank in the minds of the Irish peasantry as one of,
and a ruler among, the dhe.

he other was ssian, who did not fight at Gabhra, for, long before, he
had taken the great ourney which most heroes of mythology take, to that
bourne from which no ordinary mortal ever returns. ike Cuchulainn, it
was upon the invitation of a goddess that he went. he enians were
hunting near ake illarney when a lady of more than human beauty came
to them, and told them that her name was iamh2, daughter of the on
of the ea. he Gaelic poet, Michael Comyn, who, in the eighteenth
century, rewove the ancient story into his own words,2 describes her
in ust the same way as one of the old bards would have done

          â€A royal crown was on her head
           And a brown mantle of precious silk,
           pangled with stars of red gold,
           Covering her shoes down to the grass.

          â€A gold ring was hanging down
           rom each yellow curl of her golden hair
           er eyes, blue, clear, and cloudless,
           ike a dewdrop on the top of the grass.

          â€edder were her cheeks than the rose,
           airer was her visage than the swan upon the wave,
           And more sweet was the taste of her balsam lips
           han honey mingled throâ€ red wine.

          â€A garment, wide, long, and smooth
           Covered the white steed,
           here was a comely saddle of red gold,
           And her right hand held a bridle with a golden bit.

          â€our shoes wellshaped were under him,
           f the yellow gold of the purest uality
           A silver wreath was on the back of his head,
           And there was not in the world a steed better.â€

uch was iamh of the Golden air, Manannnâ€s daughter and it is small
wonder that, when she chose ssian from among the sons of men to be her
lover, all innâ€s supplications could not keep him. e mounted behind
her on her fairy horse, and they rode across the land to the seashore,
and then over the tops of the waves. As they went, she described the
country of the gods to him in ust the same terms as Manannn himself
had pictured it to ran, son of ebal, as Mider had painted it to tain,
and as everyone that went there limned it to those that stayed at home
on earth.

        â€It is the most delightful country to be found
         f greatest repute under the sun
         rees drooping with fruit and blossom,
         And foliage growing on the tops of boughs.

        â€Abundant, there, are honey and wine,
         And everything that eye has beheld,
         here will not come decline on thee with lapse of time.
         eath or decay thou wilt not see.â€

As they went they saw wonders. airy palaces with bright sunbowers and
limewhite walls appeared on the surface of the sea. At one of these
they halted, and ssian, at iamhâ€s reuest, attacked a fierce omor who
lived there, and set free a damsel of the uatha  anann whom he kept
imprisoned. e saw a hornless fawn leap from wave to wave, chased by one
of those strange hounds of Celtic myth which are pure white, with red
ears. At last they reached the â€and of the Youngâ€, and there ssian
dwelt with iamh for three hundred years before he remembered rin and
the enians. hen a great wish came upon him to see his own country and
his own people again, and iamh gave him leave to go, and mounted him
upon a fairy steed for the ourney. ne thing alone she made him
swearâ€”not to let his feet touch earthly soil. ssian promised, and
reached Ireland on the wings of the wind. ut, like the children of r
at the end of their penance, he found all changed. e asked for inn and
the enians, and was told that they were the names of people who had
lived long ago, and whose deeds were written of in old books. he attle
of Gabhra had been fought, and t. atrick had come to Ireland, and made
all things new. he very forms of men had altered they seemed dwarfs
compared with the giants of his day. eeing three hundred of them trying
in vain to raise a marble slab, he rode up to them in contemptuous
kindness, and lifted it with one hand. ut, as he did so, the golden
saddlegirth broke with the strain, and he touched the earth with his
feet. he fairy horse vanished, and ssian rose from the ground, no
longer divinely young and fair and strong, but a blind, grayhaired,
withered old man.

A number of spirited ballads2 tell how ssian, stranded in his old
age upon earthly soil, unable to help himself or find his own food, is
taken by t. atrick into his house to be converted. he saint paints to
him in the brightest colours the heaven which may be his own if he will
but repent, and in the darkest the hell in which he tells him his old
comrades now lie in anguish. ssian replies to the saintâ€s arguments,
entreaties, and threats in language which is extraordinarily frank. e
will not believe that heaven could be closed to the enians if they
wished to enter it, or that God himself would not be proud to claim
friendship with inn. And if it be not so, what is the use to him of
eternal life where there is no hunting, or wooing fair women, or
listening to the songs and tales of bards o, he will go to the
enians, whether they sit at the feast or in the fire and so he dies as
he had lived.

In spite, however, of the widespread popularity of the ballads that
took the form of dialogues between ssian and atrick, certain
traditions say that the saint succeeded in converting the hero. Caoilt,
the other great surviving enian, was also represented as having gladly
exchanged his pagan lore for the faith and salvation offered him. We may
see the same influence on foot in the later legends concerning the ed
ranch Champions. It was the policy of the first Christianizers of
Ireland to describe the loved heroes of their still halfheathen flocks
as having handed in their submission to the new creed. he tales about
Conchobar and Cuchulainn were amended, to prove that those very pagan
personages had been miraculously brought to accept the gospel at the
last. An entirely new story told how the latter hero was raised from the
dead by aint atrick that he might bear witness of the truth of
Christianity to aogaire the econd, ing of Ireland, which he did with
such fervour and elouence that the sceptical monarch was
convinced.20

aring attempts were also made to change the uatha  anann from pagan
gods into Christian saints, but these were by no means so profitable as
the policy pursued towards the more humanseeming heroes. With one of
them alone, was success immediate and brilliant. rigit, the goddess of
fire, poetry, and the hearth, is famous today as aint ridget, or
ride. Most popular of all the Irish saints, she can still be easily
recognized as the daughter of the agda. er Christian attributes,
almost all connected with fire, attest her pagan origin.2 he was
born at sunrise a house in which she dwelt blazed into a flame which
reached to heaven a pillar of fire rose from her head when she took the
veil and her breath gave new life to the dead. As with the ritish
goddess ul, worshipped at ath, whoâ€”the first century atin writer
olinus22 tells usâ€”â€ruled over the boiling springs, and at her altar
there flamed a perpetual fire which never whitened into ashes, but
hardened into a stony massâ€, the sacred flame on her shrine at ildare
was never allowed to go out. It was extinguished once, in the thirteenth
century, but was relighted, and burnt with undying glow until the
suppression of the monasteries by enry the ighth. his sacred fire
might not be breathed on by the impure human breath. or nineteen nights
it was tended by her nuns, but on the twentieth night it was left
untouched, and kept itself alight miraculously. With so little of her
essential character and ritual changed, it is small wonder that the
halfpagan, halfChristian Irish gladly accepted the new saint in the
stead of the old goddess.

oubtless a careful examination of Irish hagiology would result in the
discovery of many other saints whose names and attributes might render
them suspect of previous careers as pagan gods. ut their acceptation
was not sufficiently general to do away with the need of other means of
counteracting the still living influence of the Gaelic antheon.
herefore a fresh school of euhemerists arose to prove that the gods
were never even saints, but merely worldly men who had once lived and
ruled in rin. earned monks worked hard to construct a history of
Ireland from the lood downwards. Mr. ugene â€Curry has compiled from
the various pedigrees they elaborated, and inserted into the books of
allymote, ecan, and einster an amazing genealogy which shows how, not
merely the uatha  anann, but also the ir olgs, the omors, the
Milesians, and the races of artholon and emed were descended from
oah. aphet, the patriarchâ€s son, was the father of Magog, from whom
came two lines, the first being the Milesians, while the second branched
out into all the other races.2

aving once worked the gods, first into universal history, and then into
the history of Ireland, it was an easy matter to supply them with dates
of birth and death, local habitations, and places of burial. We are told
with precision exactly how long uada, the agda, ugh, and the others
reigned at ara. he barrows by the oyne provided them with comfortable
tombs. heir enemies, the omors, became real invaders who were beaten
in real battles. hus it was thought to make plain prose of their
divinities.

It is only fair, however, to these early euhemerists to say that they
have their modern disciples. here are many writers, of recognized
authority upon their subects, who, in dealing with the history of
Ireland or the composition of the ritish race, claim to find real
peoples in the tribes mentioned in Gaelic myth. nfortunately, the only
point they agree upon is the accepted oneâ€”that the â€Milesiansâ€ were
Aryan Celts. hey are divided upon the uestion of the â€ir olgsâ€, in
whom some see the preAryan tribes, while others, led astray by the
name, regard them as elgic Gauls and over the really mythological
races they run wild. In the uatha  anann are variously found Gaels,
icts, anes, candinavians, igurians, and inns, while the omors rest
under the suspicion of having been Iberians, Moors, omans, inns,
Goths, or eutons. As for the people of artholon and emed, they have
even been explained as men of the alolithic Age. his chaos of opinion
was fortunately avoided by the native annalists, who had no particular
views upon the uestion of race, except that everybody came from
â€painâ€.

f course there were dissenters from this prevailing mania for
euhemerization. As late as the tenth century, a poet called ochaid
â€lynn, writing of the uatha  anann, at first seems to hesitate
whether to ascribe humanity or divinity to them, and at last frankly
avows their godhead. In his poem, preserved in the ook of
allymote,2 he saysâ€”

        â€hough they came to learned rinn
         Without buoyant, adventurous ships,
         o man in creation knew
         Whether they were of the earth or of the sky.

        â€If they were diabolical demons,
         hey came from that woeful expulsion2
         If they were of a race of tribes and nations,
         If they were human, they were of the race of eothach.â€

hen he enumerates them in due succession, and ends by declaringâ€”

        â€hough I have treated of these deities in their order,
         Yet I have not adored themâ€.

ne may surmise with probability that the common people agreed rather
with the poet than with the monk. ious men in monasteries might write
what they liked, but mere laymen would not be easily persuaded that
their cherished gods had never been anything more than men like
themselves. robably they said little, but acted in secret according to
their inherited ideas. et it be granted, for the sake of peace, that
Goibniu was only a man none the less, his name was known to be
uncommonly effective in an incantation. his applied eually to
iancecht, and invocations to both of them are contained in some verses
which an eighthcentury Irish monk wrote on the margin of a manuscript
still preserved at t. Gall, in witzerland. ome prescriptions of
iancechtâ€s have come down to us, but it must be admitted that they
hardly differ from those current among ordinary medival physicians.
erhaps, after that unfortunate spilling of the herbs that grew out of
Miachâ€s body, he had to fall back upon empirical research. e invented a
porridge for â€the relief of ailments of the body, as cold, phlegm,
throat cats, and the presence of living things in the body, as wormsâ€
it was compounded of hazel buds, dandelion, chickweed, sorrel, and
oatmeal and was to be taken every morning and evening. e also
prescribed against the effects of witchcraft and the fourteen diseases
of the stomach.

Goibniu, in addition to his original character as the divine smith and
sorcerer, gained a third reputation among the Irish as a great builder
and bridgemaker. As such he is known as the Gobhan aer, that is,
Goibniu the Architect, and marvellous tales, current all over Ireland
attest his prowess.

           â€Men callâ€d him Gobhan aer, and many a tale
              Yet lingers in the byways of the land
            f how he cleft the rock, or down the vale
              ed the bright river, childlike, in his hand
            f how on giant ships he spread great sail,
              And many marvels else by him first plannâ€dâ€,

writes a poet of modern Ireland.2 specially were the â€round towersâ€
attributed to him, and the Christian clerics appropriated his popularity
by describing him as having been the designer of their churches. e
used, according to legend, to wander over the country, clad, like the
Greek ephaestus, whom he resembles, in working dress, seeking
commissions and adventures. is works remain in the cathedrals and
churches of Ireland and, with regard to his adventures, many strange
legends are still, or were until very recently, current upon the lips of
old people in remote parts of Ireland.

ome of these are, as might have been expected, nothing more than
halfunderstood recollections of the ancient mythology. In them appear
as characters others of the old, yet not uite forgotten godsâ€”ugh,
Manannn, and alorâ€”names still remembered as those of longpast druids,
heroes, and kings of Ireland in the misty olden time.

ne or two of them are worth retelling. Mr. William arminie,
collecting folktales in Achill Island, took one from the lips of an
aged peasant, which tells in its confused way what might almost be
called the central incident of Gaelic mythology, the mysterious birth of
the sungod from demoniac parentage, and his eventual slaying of his
grandfather when he came to full age.2

Gobhan the Architect and his son, young Gobhan, runs the tale, were sent
for by alor of the lows to build him a palace. hey built it so well
that alor decided never to let them leave his kingdom alive, for fear
they should build another one eually good for someone else. e
therefore had all the scaffolding removed from round the palace while
they were still on the top, with the intention of leaving them up there
to die of hunger. ut, when they discovered this, they began to destroy
the roof, so that alor was obliged to let them come down.

e, none the less, refused to allow them to return to Ireland. he
crafty Gobhan, however, had his plan ready. e told alor that the
inury that had been done to the palace roof could not be repaired
without special tools, which he had left behind him at home. alor
declined to let either old Gobhan or young Gobhan go back to fetch them
but he offered to send his own son. Gobhan gave alorâ€s son directions
for the ourney. e was to travel until he came to a house with a stack
of corn at the door. ntering it, he would find a woman with one hand
and a child with one eye.

alorâ€s son found the house, and asked the woman for the tools. he
expected him for it had been arranged between Gobhan and his wife what
should be done, if alor refused to let him return. he took alorâ€s son
to a huge chest, and told him that the tools were at the bottom of it,
so far down that she could not reach them, and that he must get into the
chest, and pick them up himself. ut, as soon as he was safely inside,
she shut the lid on him, telling him that he would have to stay there
until his father allowed old Gobhan and young Gobhan to come home with
their pay. And she sent the same message to alor himself.

here was an exchange of prisoners, alor giving the two Gobhans their
pay and a ship to take them home, and Gobhanâ€s wife releasing alorâ€s
son. ut, before the two builders went, alor asked them whom he should
now employ to repair his palace. ld Gobhan told him that, next to
himself, there was no workman in Ireland better than one Gavideen Go.

When Gobhan got back to Ireland, he sent Gavideen Go to alor. ut he
gave him a piece of adviceâ€”to accept as pay only one thing alorâ€s gray
cow, which would fill twenty barrels at one milking. alor agreed to
this, but, when he gave the cow to Gavideen Go to take back with him to
Ireland, he omitted to include her byrerope, which was the only thing
that would keep her from returning to her original owner.

he gray cow gave so much trouble to Gavideen Go by her straying, that
he was obliged to hire military champions to watch her during the day
and bring her safely home at night. he bargain made was that Gavideen
Go should forge the champion a sword for his pay, but that, if he lost
the cow, his life was to be forfeited.

At last, a certain warrior called Cian was unlucky enough to let the cow
escape. e followed her tracks down to the seashore and right to the
edge of the waves, and there he lost them altogether. e was tearing his
hair in his perplexity, when he saw a man rowing a coracle. he man, who
was no other than Manannn son of r, came in close to the shore, and
asked what was the matter.

Cian told him.

â€What would you give to anyone who would take you to the place where the
gray cow isâ€ asked Manannn.

â€I have nothing to give,â€ replied Cian.

â€All I ask,â€ said Manannn, â€is half of whatever you gain before you
come back.â€

Cian agreed to that willingly enough, and Manannn told him to get into
the coracle. In the wink of an eye, he had landed him in alorâ€s
kingdom, the realm of the cold, where they roast no meat, but eat their
food raw. Cian was not used to this diet, so he lit himself a fire, and
began to cook some food. alor saw the fire, and came down to it, and he
was so pleased that he appointed Cian to be his firemaker and cook.

ow alor had a daughter, of whom a druid had prophesied that she would,
some day, bear a son who would kill his grandfather. herefore, like
Acrisius, in Greek legend, he shut her up in a tower, guarded by women,
and allowed her to see no man but himself. ne day, Cian saw alor go to
the tower. e waited until he had come back, and then went to explore.
e had the gift of opening locked doors and shutting them again after
him. When he got inside, he lit a fire, and this novelty so delighted
alorâ€s daughter that she invited him to visit her again. After thisâ€”in
the Achill islanderâ€s uaint phraseâ€”â€he was ever coming there, until a
child happened to her.â€ alorâ€s daughter gave the baby to Cian to take
away. he also gave him the byrerope which belonged to the gray cow.

Cian was in great danger now, for alor had found out about the child.
e led the gray cow away with the rope to the seashore, and waited for
Manannn. he on of r had told Cian that, when he was in any
difficulty, he was to think of him, and he would at once appear. Cian
thought of him now, and, in a moment, Manannn appeared with his
coracle. Cian got into the boat, with the baby and the gray cow, ust as
alor, in hot pursuit, came down to the beach.

alor, by his incantations, raised a great storm to drown them but
Manannn, whose druidism was greater, stilled it. hen alor turned the
sea into fire, to burn them but Manannn put it out with a stone.

When they were safe back in Ireland, Manannn asked Cian for his
promised reward.

â€I have gained nothing but the boy, and I cannot cut him in two, so I
will give him to you whole,â€ he replied.

â€hat is what I was wanting all the time,â€ said Manannn â€when he grows
up, there will be no champion eual to him.â€

o Manannn baptized the boy, calling him â€the ulaunaâ€. his name,
meaning â€lindtubbornâ€, is certainly a curious corruption of the
original Ioldanach2 â€Master of all nowledgeâ€. When the boy had
grown up, he went one day to the seashore. A ship came past, in which
was a man. he traditions of onnybrook air are evidently prehistoric,
for the boy, without troubling to ask who the stranger was, took a dart
â€out of his pocketâ€, hurled it, and hit him. he man in the boat
happened to be alor. hus, in accordance with the prophecy, he was
slain by his grandson, who, though the folktale does not name him, was
obviously ugh.

Another version of the same legend, collected by the Irish scholar
â€onovan on the coast of onegal, opposite alor s favourite haunt,
ory Island, is interesting as completing the one ust narrated.2 In
this folktale, Goibniu is called Gavida, and is made one of three
brothers, the other two being called Mac ineely and Mac amthainn. hey
were chiefs of onegal, smiths and farmers, while alor was a robber who
harassed the mainland from his stronghold on ory Island. he gray cow
belonged to Mac ineely, and alor stole it. Its owner determined to be
revenged, and, knowing the prediction concerning alorâ€s death at the
hands of an as yet unborn grandson, he persuaded a kindly fairy to
spirit him in female disguise to or Mor, where alorâ€s daughter, who
was called thnea, was kept imprisoned. he result of this expedition
was not merely the one son necessary to fulfil the prophecy, but three.
his apparent superfluity was fortunate for alor drowned two of them,
the other being picked out of the sea by the same fairy who had been
incidentally responsible for his birth, and handed over to his father,
Mac ineely, to be brought up. hortly after this, alor managed to
capture Mac ineely, and, in retaliation for the wrong done him, chopped
off his head upon a large white stone, still known locally as the â€tone
of ineelyâ€. atisfied with this, and uite unaware that one of his
daughterâ€s children had been saved from death, and was now being brought
up as a smith by Gavida, alor went on with his career of robbery,
varying it by visits to the forge to purchase arms. ne day, being there
during Gavidaâ€s absence, he began boasting to the young assistant of how
he had compassed Mac ineelyâ€s death. e never finished the story, for
ughâ€”which was the boyâ€s nameâ€”snatched a redhot iron from the fire, and
thrust it into alorâ€s eye, and through his head.

hus, in these two folktales,20 gathered in different parts of
Ireland, at different times, by different persons, survives uite a mass
of mythological detail only to be found otherwise in ancient manuscripts
containing still more ancient matter. Crystallized in them may be found
the names of six members of the old Gaelic antheon, each filling the
same part as of old. Goibniu has not lost his mastery of smithcraft
alor is still the omorian king of the cold regions of the sea his
daughter thniu becomes, by Cian, the mother of the sungod ugh, who
still bears his old title of Ioldanach, though it is strangely
corrupted into a name meaning almost the exact opposite, is still
fostered by Manannn, on of the ea, and in the end grows up to destroy
his grandfather by a blow in the one vulnerable place, his deathdealing
eye. erhaps, too, we may claim to see a genuine, though umbled
tradition, in the omorlike deformities of Gobhanâ€s wife and child, and
in the story of the gray cow and her byrerope, which recalls that of
the agdaâ€s blackmaned heifer, cean.

he memories of the peasantry still hold many stories of ugh, as well
as of Angus, and others of the old gods. ut, next to the Gobhan aer,
the one whose fame is still greatest is that everpotent and
everpopular figure, the great Manannn.

he last, perhaps, to receive open adoration, he is represented by
kindly tradition as having been still content to help and watch over the
people who had reected and ceased to worship him. p to the time of t.
Columba, he was the special guardian of Irishmen in foreign parts,
assisting them in their dangers and bringing them home safe. or the
peasantry, too, he caused favourable weather and good crops. is fairy
subects tilled the ground while men slept. ut this is said to have
come to an end at last. aint Columba, having broken his golden chalice,
gave it to a servant to get repaired. n his way, the servant was met by
a stranger, who asked him where he was going. he man told him, and
showed him the chalice. he stranger breathed upon it, and, at once, the
broken parts reunited. hen he begged him to return to his master, give
him the chalice, and tell him that Manannn son of r, who had mended
it, desired to know in very truth whether he would ever attain paradise.
â€Alas,â€ said the ungrateful saint, â€there is no forgiveness for a man
who does such works as thisâ€ he servant went back with the answer, and
Manannn, when he heard it, broke out into indignant lament. â€Woe is me,
Manannn mac r for years Iâ€ve helped the Catholics of Ireland, but
Iâ€ll do it no more, till theyâ€re as weak as water. Iâ€ll go to the gray
waves in the ighlands of cotland.â€2

And there he remained. or, unless the charming stories of Miss iona
Macleod are mere beautiful imaginings and nothing more, he is not
unknown even today among the solitary shepherds and fishers of â€the
farthest ebridesâ€. In the Contemporary eview for ctober, 02,22
she tells how an old man of fourscore years would often be visited in
his shieling by a tall, beautiful stranger, with a crest on his head,
â€like white canna blowing in the wind, but with a blueness in itâ€, and
â€a bright, cold, curling flame under the soles of his feetâ€. he man
told him many things, and prophesied to him the time of his death.
Generally, the strangerâ€s hands were hidden in the folds of the white
cloak he wore, but, once, he moved to touch the shepherd, who saw then
that his flesh was like water, with seaweed floating among the bones.
o that Murdo MacIan knew that he could be speaking with none other than
the on of the ea.

or is he yet uite forgotten in his own Island of Man, of which local
tradition says he was the first inhabitant. e is also described as its
king, who kept it from invasion by his magic. e would cause mists to
rise at any moment and conceal the island, and by the same glamour he
could make one man seem like a hundred, and little chips of wood which
he threw into the water to appear like ships of war. It is no wonder
that he held his kingdom against allcomers, until his sway was ended,
like that of the other Gaelic gods, by the arrival of aint atrick.
After this, he seems to have declined into a traditionary giant who used
to leap from eel Castle to Contrary ead for exercise, or hurl huge
rocks, upon which the mark of his hand can still be seen. It is said
that he took no tribute from his subects, or worshippers except bundles
of green rushes, which were placed every Midsummer ve upon two mountain
peaks, one called Warrefield in olden days, but now outh arrule, and
the other called Man, and not now to be identified. is grave, which is
thirty yards long, is pointed out, close to eel Castle. he most
curious legend connected with him, however, tells us that he had three
legs, on which he used to travel at a great pace. ow this was done may
be seen from the arms of the island, on which are pictured his three
limbs, oined together, and spread out like the spokes of a wheel.2

An Irish tradition tells us that, when Manannn left Ireland for
cotland, the vacant kingship of the gods or fairies was taken by one
Mac Moineanta, to the great grief of those who had known Manannn.2
erhaps this great grief led to Mac Moineantaâ€s being deposed, for the
present king of the Irish fairies is invarra, the same ionnbharr to
whom the agda allotted the sdh of Meadha after the conuest of the
uatha  anann by the Milesians, and who takes a prominent part in the
enian stories. o great is the persistence of tradition in Ireland that
this hill of Meadha, now spelt nockma, is still considered to be the
abode of him and his ueen, nagh. umberless stories are told about
invarra, including, of course, that very favourite Celtic tale of the
stolen bride, and her recapture from the fairies by the siege and
digging up of the sdh in which she was held prisoner. invarra, like
Mider of ri eith, carried away a human tainâ€”the wife, not of a high
king, but of an Irish lord. he modern ochaid Airem, having heard an
invisible voice tell him where he was to look for his lost bride,
gathered all his workmen and labourers and proceeded to demolish
nockma. very day they almost dug it up, but every night the breach was
found to have been repaired by fairy workmen of invarraâ€s. his went on
for three days, when the Irish lord thought of the wellknown device of
sanctifying the work of excavation by sprinkling the turnedup earth
with salt. eedless to say, it succeeded. invarra gave back the bride,
still in the trance into which he had thrown her and the deep cut into
the fairy hill still remains to furnish proof to the incredulous.2

invarra does not always appear, however, in such unfriendly guise. e
was popularly reputed to have under his special care the family of the
irwans of Castle acket, on the northern slope of nockma. wing to his
benevolent influence, the castle cellars never went dry, nor did the
uality of the wine deteriorate. esides the winecellar, invarra
looked after the stables, and it was owing to the exercise that he and
his fairy followers gave the horses by night that Mr. ohn irwanâ€s
racers were so often successful on the Curragh. hat such stories could
have passed current as fact, which they undoubtedly did, is excellent
proof of how late and how completely a mythology may survive among the
uncultured.2

invarra rules today over a wide realm of fairy folk. Many of these,
again, have their own vassal chieftains, forming a tribal hierarchy such
as must have existed in the Celtic days of Ireland. invarra and nagh
are high king and ueen, but, under them, Cliodna2 is tributary
ueen of Munster, and rules from a sdh near Mallow in County Cork,
while, under her again, are Aoibhinn2, ueen of the fairies of orth
Munster, and Ain, ueen of the fairies of outh Munster. hese names
form but a single instance. A map of fairy Ireland could without much
difficulty be drawn, showing, with almost political exactness, the
various kingdoms of the dhe.

ar less easy, however, would be the task of ascertaining the origin and
lineage of these fabled beings. ome of them can still be traced as
older gods and goddesses. In the eastern parts of Ireland, adb and her
sisters have become â€bansheesâ€ who wail over deaths not necessarily
found in battle. Aynia, deemed the most powerful fairy in lster, and
Ain, ueen of outh Munster, are perhaps the same person, the
mysterious and awful goddess once adored as Anu, or anu. f the two, it
is Ain who especially seems to carry on the traditions of the older
Anu, worshipped, according to the â€Choice of amesâ€, in Munster as a
goddess of prosperity and abundance. Within living memory, she was
propitiated by a magical ritual upon every aint ohnâ€s ve, to ensure
fertility during the coming year. he villagers round her sdh of Cnoc
Ain nockainy carried burning bunches of hay or straw upon poles to
the top of the hill, and thence dispersed among the fields, waving these
torches over the crops and cattle. his fairy, or goddess was held to be
friendly, and, indeed, more than friendly, to men. Whether or not she
were the mother of the gods, she is claimed as first ancestress by half
a dozen famous Irish families.

Among her children was the famous arl Gerald, offspring of her alliance
with the fourth arl of esmond, known as â€he Magicianâ€. As in the
wellknown story of the wanmaidens, the magicianearl is said to have
stolen Ainâ€s cloak while she was bathing, and refused to return it
unless she became his bride. ut, in the end, he lost her. Ain had
warned her husband never to show surprise at anything done by their son
but a wonderful feat which he performed made the earl break this
condition, and Ain was obliged, by fairy law, to leave him. ut, though
she had lost her husband, she was not separated from her son, who was
received into the fairy world after his death, and now lives under the
surface of ough Gur, in County imerick, waiting, like the ritish
Arthur, for the hour to strike in which he shall lead forth his warriors
to drive the foreigners from Ireland. ut this will not be until, by
riding round the lake once in every seventh year, he shall have worn his
horseâ€s silver shoes as thin as a catâ€s ear.2

ot only the tribe of anu, but heroes of the other mythical cycles
swell the fairy host today. onn, son of Mil, who was drowned before
ever he set foot on Irish soil, lives at â€onnâ€s ouseâ€, a line of
sandhills in the ingle eninsula of erry, and, as late as the
eighteenth century, we find him invoked by a local poet, half in est,
no doubt, but still, perhaps also a little in earnest.20 he heroes
of lster have no part in fairyland but their enemy, Medb, is credited
with ueenly rule among the dhe, and is held by some to have been the
original of â€ueen Mabâ€. Caoilt, last of the enians, was, in spite of
his leanings towards Christianity, enrolled among the uatha  anann,
but none of his kin are known there, neither ssian, nor scar, nor even
inn himself. Yet not even to merely historical mortals are the gates of
the gods necessarily closed. he arry, chief of the barony of
arrymore, is said to inhabit an enchanted palace in nockthierna, one
of the agles ills. he not less traditionally famous â€onaghue, whose
domain was near illarney, now dwells beneath the waters of that lake,
and may still be seen, it is said, upon May ay.2

ut besides these figures, which can be traced in mythology or history,
and others who, though all written record of them has perished, are
obviously of the same character, there are numerous beings who suggest a
different origin from that of the Aryanseeming fairies. hey correspond
to the elves and trolls of candinavian, or the silenoi and satyrs of
Greek myth. uch is the eprechaun, who makes shoes for the fairies, and
knows where hidden treasures are the Gan Ceanach, or â€lovetalkerâ€, who
fills the ears of idle girls with pleasant fancies when, to merely
mortal ideas, they should be busy with their work the ooka, who leads
travellers astray, or, taking the shape of an ass or mule, beguiles them
to mount upon his back to their discomfiture the ulachan, who rides
without a head and other friendly or malicious sprites. Whence come
they A possible answer suggests itself. receding the Aryans, and
surviving the Aryan conuest all over urope, was a large nonAryan
population, which must have had its own gods, who would retain their
worship, be revered by successive generations, and remain rooted to the
soil. May not these uncouth and halfdeveloped Irish eprechauns,
ookas, and ulachans, together with the cotch Cluricanes, rownies,
and their kin, be no â€creations of popular fancyâ€, but the dwindling
figures of those darker gods of â€the dark Iberiansâ€

he descriptions and the stories of the ritish gods have hardly come
down to us in so ample or so compact a form as those of the deities of
the Gaels, as they are preserved in the Irish and cottish manuscripts.
hey have also suffered far more from the sophistications of the
euhemerist. nly in the â€our ranches of the Mabinogiâ€ do the gods of
the ritons appear in anything like their real character of supernatural
beings, masters of magic, and untrammelled by the limitations which
hedge in mortals. Apart from those four fragments of mythology, and from
a very few scattered references in the early Welsh poems, one must
search for them under strange disguises. ome masuerade as kings in
Geoffrey of Monmouthâ€s more than apocryphal istoria ritonum. thers
have received an undeserved canonization, which must be stripped from
them before they can be seen in their true colours. thers, again, were
adopted by the ormanrench romancers, and turned into the champions of
chivalry now known as Arthurâ€s nights of the ound able. ut, however
disguised, their real nature can still be discerned. he Gaels and the
ritons were but two branches of one raceâ€”the Celtic. In many of the
gods of the ritons we shall recognize, with names alike and attributes
the same, the familiar features of the Gaelic uatha  anann.

he ritish gods are sometimes described as divided into three
familiesâ€”the â€Children of nâ€, the â€Children of uddâ€, and the
â€Children of lyrâ€. ut these three families are really only two for
udd, or ludd, as he is variously called, is himself described as a son
of eli, who was the husband of the goddess n. here can be no doubt
that n herself is the same divine personage as anu, the mother of the
uatha  anann, and that eli is the ritish euivalent of the Gaelic
il, the universal is ater who sent out the first Gaels from ades to
take possession of Ireland. With the other family, the â€Children of
lyrâ€, we are eually on familiar ground for the ritish lyr can be
none other than the Gaelic seagod r. hese two families or tribes are
usually regarded as in opposition, and their struggles seem to symbolize
in ritish myth that same conflict between the powers of heaven, light,
and life and of the sea, darkness, and death which are shadowed in
Gaelic mythology in the battles between the uatha  anann and the
omors.

or the children of n were certainly gods of the sky. heir names are
writ large in heaven. he glittering W which we call â€Cassiopeiaâ€s
Chairâ€ was to our ritish ancestors lys n, or â€nâ€s Courtâ€ our
â€orthern Crownâ€ was Caer Arianrod, the â€Castle of Arianrodâ€, nâ€s
daughter while the â€Milky Wayâ€ was the â€Castle of Gwydionâ€, nâ€s
son.22 More than this, the greatest of her children, the udd or
ludd whom some make the head of a dynasty of his own, was the eus
alike of the ritons and of the Gaels. is epithet of law reint,
that is, â€of the and of ilverâ€, proves him the same personage as uada
the â€ilverandedâ€. he legend which must have existed to explain this
peculiarity has been lost on ritish ground, but it was doubtless the
same as that told of the Irish god. With it, and, no doubt, much else,
has disappeared any direct account of battles fought by him as skygod
against omorlike enemies. ut, under the faint disguise of a king of
ritain, an ancient Welsh tale2 records how he put an end to three
supernatural â€plaguesâ€ which oppressed his country. In addition to this,
we find him under his name of udd described in a Welsh riad as one of
â€the three generous heroes of the Isle of ritainâ€, while another makes
him the owner of twentyone thousand milch cowsâ€”an expression which
must, to the primitive mind, have implied inexhaustible wealth. oth
help us to the conception of a god of heaven and battle, triumphant, and
therefore rich and liberal.2

More tangible evidence is, however, not lacking to prove the widespread
nature of his worship. A temple dedicated to him in oman times under
the name of odens, or udens, has been discovered at ydney, on the
banks of the evern. he god is pictured on a plaue of bronze as a
youthful deity, haloed like the sun, and driving a fourhorsed chariot.
lying spirits, typifying the winds, accompany him while his power over
the sea is symbolized by attendant ritons.2 his was in the west of
ritain, while, in the east, there is good reason to believe that he had
a shrine overlooking the hames. radition declares that t. aulâ€s
Cathedral occupies the site of an ancient pagan temple while the spot
on which it stands was called, we know from Geoffrey of Monmouth, â€arth
luddâ€ by the ritons, and â€udes Geatâ€ by the axons.2

Great, however, as he probably was, ludd, or udd occupies less space
in Welsh story, as we have it now, than his son. Gwyn ap udd has
outlived in tradition almost all his supernatural kin. rofessor hys is
tempted to see in him the ritish euivalent of the Gaelic inn mac
Cumhail.2 he name of both alike means â€whiteâ€ both are sons of the
heavengod both are famed as hunters. Gwyn, however, is more than that
for his game is man. In the early Welsh poems, he is a god of battle and
of the dead, and, as such, fills the part of a psychopompos,
conducting the slain into ades, and there ruling over them. In later,
semiChristianized story he is described as â€Gwyn, son of udd, whom God
has placed over the brood of devils in Annwn, lest they should destroy
the present race2â€. ater again, as paganism still further
degenerated, he came to be considered as king of the ylwyth eg, the
Welsh fairies,2 and his name as such has hardly yet died out of his
last haunt, the romantic vale of eath. e is the wild huntsman of Wales
and the West of ngland, and it is his pack which is sometimes heard at
chase in waste places by night.

In his earliest guise, as a god of war and death, he is the subect of a
poem in dialogue contained in the lack ook of Caermarthen.20
bscure, like most of the ancient Welsh poems,2 it is yet a spirited
production, and may be uoted here as a favourable specimen of the
poetry of the early Cymri. In it we shall see mirrored perhaps the
clearest figure of the ritish antheon, the â€mighty hunterâ€, not of
deer, but of menâ€s souls, riding his demon horse, and cheering on his
demon hound to the fearful chase. e knows when and where all the great
warriors fell, for he gathered their souls upon the field of battle, and
now rules over them in ades, or upon some â€misty mountaintopâ€.22 It
describes a mythical prince, named Gwyddneu Garanhir, known to Welsh
legend as the ruler of a lost country now covered by the waters of
Cardigan ay, asking protection of the god, who accords it, and then
relates the story of his exploits

                    Gwyddneu.

    A bull of conflict was he, active in dispersing an arrayed army,
    he ruler of hosts, indisposed to anger,
    lameless and pure his conduct in protecting life.

                      Gwyn.

    Against a hero stout was his advance,
    he ruler of hosts, disposer of wrath,
    here will be protection for thee since thou askest it.

                    Gwyddneu.

    or thou hast given me protection
    ow warmly wert thou welcomed
    he hero of hosts, from what region thou comest

                      Gwyn.

    I come from battle and conflict
    With a shield in my hand
    roken is the helmet by the pushing of spears.

                    Gwyddneu.

    I will address thee, exalted man,
    With his shield in distress.
    rave man, what is thy descent

                      Gwyn.

    oundhoofed is my horse, the torment of battle,
    airy am I called, Gwyn the son of udd,2
    he lover of Creurdilad, the daughter of ludd.

                    Gwyddneu.

    ince it is thou, Gwyn, an upright man,
    rom thee there is no concealing
    I am Gwyddneu Garanhir.

                      Gwyn.

    enowned and splendid was he who made the assault.

                    Gwyddneu.

    Gwyn, son of udd, the hope of armies,
    uicker would legions fall before the hoofs
    f thy horse than broken rushes to the ground.

                      Gwyn.

    hy wanderings on Gwibir ynyd.2

                      Gwyn.

    he son of Ceidaw, the pillar of songs,
    When the ravens screamed over blood.

    I have been in the place where rn was killed,

    When the ravens of the battlefield screamed.

    I have been where lacheu was slain,

    When the ravens screamed over flesh.

    I have been where Gwallawg was killed,

    he resister of loegyr, the son of leynawg.

    I have been where the soldiers of ritain were slain,

    I am the escort of the grave.2

    I have been where the soldiers of ritain were slain,
    rom the east to the south
    I am alive, they in death

A line in this poem allows us to see Gwyn in another and less sinister
rle. â€he lover of Creurdilad, the daughter of ludd,â€ he calls
himself and an episode in the mythical romance of â€ulhwch and lwenâ€,
preserved in the ed ook of ergest, gives the details of his
courtship. Gwyn had as rival a deity called Gwyrthur ap Greidawl, that
is â€ictor, son of corcherâ€.2 hese two waged perpetual war for
Creurdilad, or Creudylad, each in turn stealing her from the other,
until the matter was referred to Arthur, who decided that Creudylad
should be sent back to her father, and that Gwyn and Gwyrthur â€should
fight for her every first of May, from henceforth until the day of doom,
and that whichever of them should then be conueror should have the
maidenâ€. What satisfaction this would be to the survivor of what might
be somewhat flippantly described as, in two senses, the longest
engagement on record, is not very clear but its mythological
interpretation appears fairly obvious. In Gwyn, god of death and the
underworld, and in the solar deity, Gwyrthur, we may see the powers of
darkness and sunshine, of winter and summer, in contest,00 each
alternately winning and losing a bride who would seem to represent the
spring with its grain and flowers. Creudylad, whom the story of â€ulhwch
and lwenâ€ calls â€the most splendid maiden in the three islands of the
mighty and in the three islands adacentâ€, is, in fact, the ritish
ersephon. As the daughter of ludd, she is child of the shining sky.
ut a different tradition must have made her a daughter of lyr, the
seagod for her name as such passed, through Geoffrey of Monmouth, to
hakespeare, in whose hands she became that pathetic figure, Cordelia in
â€ing earâ€. It may not be altogether unworthy of notice, though perhaps
it is only a coincidence, that in some myths the Greek ersephon is
made a daughter of eus and in others of oseidon.0

urning from the skygod and his son, we find others of nâ€s children
to have been the exponents of those arts of life which early races held
to have been taught directly by the gods to men. n herself had a
brother, Mth, son of a mysterious Mthonwy, and recognizable as a
benevolent ruler of the underworld akin to eli, or perhaps that god
himself under another title, for the name Mth, which means â€coin,
money, treasureâ€,02 recalls that of louton, the Greek god of ades,
in his guise of possessor and giver of metals. It was a belief common to
the Aryan races that wisdom, as well as wealth, came originally from the
underworld and we find Mth represented, in the Mabinogi bearing his
name, as handing on his magical lore to his nephew and pupil Gwydion,
who, there is good reason to believe, was the same divine personage whom
the eutonic tribes worshipped as â€Wodenâ€ and â€dinâ€. hus euipped,
Gwydion son of n became the druid of the gods, the â€master of illusion
and phantasyâ€, and, not only that, but the teacher of all that is useful
and good, the friend and helper of mankind, and the perpetual fighter
against niggardly underworld powers for the good gifts which they
refused to allow out of their keeping. houlder to shoulder with him in
this â€holy warâ€ of culture against ignorance, and light against
darkness, stood his brothers Amaethon, god of agriculture, and Govannan,
a god of smithcraft identical with the Gaelic Giobniu. e had also a
sister called Arianrod, or â€ilver Circleâ€, who, as is common in
mythologies, was not only his sister, but also his wife. o eus wedded
er and, indeed, it is difficult to say where otherwise the partners
of gods are to come from. f this connection two sons were born at one
birthâ€”ylan and leu, who are considered as representing the twin powers
of darkness and light. With darkness the sea was inseparably connected
by the Celts, and, as soon as the dark twin was born and named, he
plunged headlong into his native element. â€And immediately when he was
in the sea,â€ says the Mabinogi of Mth, son of Mthonwy, â€he took its
nature, and swam as well as the best fish that was therein. And for that
reason was he called ylan, the on of the Wave. eneath him no wave
ever broke.â€ e was killed with a spear at last by his uncle, Govannan,
and, according to the bard aliesin, the waves of ritain, Ireland,
cotland, and the Isle of Man wept for him.0 eautiful legends grew
up around his death. he clamour of the waves dashing upon the beach is
the expression of their longing to avenge their son. he sound of the
sea rushing up the mouth of the iver Conway is still known as â€ylanâ€s
deathgroanâ€0. A small promontory on the Carnarvonshire side of the
Menai traits, called wynt Maen ylen, or wynt Maen ulan,
preserves his name.0

he other child of Gwydion and Arianrod grew up to become the ritish
sungod, leu law Gyffes, the exact counterpart of the Gaelic ugh
amhfada, â€ight the onghandedâ€. ike all solar deities, his growth
was rapid. When he was a year old, he seemed to be two years at the age
of two, he travelled by himself and when he was four years old, he was
as tall as a boy of eight, and was his fatherâ€s constant companion.

ne day, Gwydion took him to the castle of Arianrodâ€”not her castle in
the sky, but her abode on earth, the stillremembered site of which is
marked by a patch of rocks in the Menai traits, accessible without a
boat only during the lowest spring and autumn tides. Arianrod had
disowned her son, and did not recognize him when she saw him with
Gwydion. he asked who he was, and was much displeased when told. he
demanded to know his name, and, when Gwydion replied that he had as yet
received none, she â€laid a destiny uponâ€ him, after the fashion of the
Celts, that he should be without a name until she chose to bestow one on
him herself.

o be without a name was a very serious thing to the ancient ritons,
who seem to have held the primitive theory that the name and the soul
are the same. o Gwydion cast about to think by what craft he might
extort from Arianrod some remark from which he could name their son. he
next day, he went down to the seashore with the boy, both of them
disguised as cordwainers. e made a boat out of seaweed by magic, and
some beautifullycoloured leather out of some dry sticks and sedges.
hen they sailed the boat to the port of Arianrodâ€s castle, and,
anchoring it where it could be seen, began ostentatiously to stitch away
at the leather. aturally, they were soon noticed, and Arianrod sent
someone out to see who they were and what they were doing. When she
found that they were shoemakers, she remembered that she wanted some
shoes. Gwydion, though he had her measure, purposely made them, first
too large, and then too small. his brought Arianrod herself down to the
boat to be fitted.

While Gwydion was measuring Arianrodâ€s foot for the shoes, a wren came
and stood upon the deck. he boy took his bow and arrow, and hit the
wren in the legâ€”a favourite shot of Celtic â€crackâ€ archers, at any rate
in romance. he goddess was pleased to be amiable and complimentary.
â€ruly,â€ said she, â€the lion aimed at it with a steady hand.â€ It is from
such incidents that primitive people take their names, all the world
over. he boy had got his. â€It is no thanks to you,â€ said Gwydion to
Arianrod, â€but now he has a name. And a good name it is. e shall be
called lew law Gyffes0.â€

his name of the sungod is a good example of how obsolete the ancient
pagan tradition had become before it was put into writing. he old word
leu, meaning â€lightâ€, had passed out of use, and the scribe
substituted for a name that was unintelligible to him one like it which
he knew, namely lew, meaning â€lionâ€. he word Gyffes seems also to
have suffered change, and to have meant originally not â€steadyâ€, but
â€longâ€0.

At any rate, Arianrod was defeated in her design to keep her son
nameless. either did she even get her shoes for, as soon as he had
gained his obect, Gwydion allowed the boat to change back into
seaweed, and the leather to return to sedge and sticks. o, in her
anger, she put a fresh destiny on the boy, that he should not take arms
till she herself gave them him.

Gwydion, however, took leu to inas inllev, his castle, which still
stands at the edge of the Menai traits, and brought him up as a
warrior. As soon as he thought him old enough to have arms, he took him
with him again to Caer Arianrod. his time, they were disguised as
bards. Arianrod received them gladly, heard Gwydionâ€s songs and tales,
feasted them, and prepared a room for them to sleep in.

he next morning, Gwydion got up very early, and prepared his most
powerful incantations. y his druidical arts he made it seem as if the
whole country rang with the shouts and trumpets of an army, and he put a
glamour over everyone, so that they saw the bay filled with ships.
Arianrod came to him in terror, asking what could be done to protect the
castle. â€Give us arms,â€ he replied, â€and we will do the best we can.â€ o
Arianrodâ€s maidens armed Gwydion, while Arianrod herself put arms on
leu. y the time she had finished, all the noises had ceased, and the
ships had vanished. â€et us take our arms off again,â€ said Gwydion â€we
shall not need them now.â€ â€ut the army is all round the castleâ€ cried
Arianrod. â€here was no army,â€ answered Gwydion â€it was only an
illusion of mine to cause you to break your prophecy and give our son
arms. And now he has got them, without thanks to you.â€ â€hen I will lay
a worse destiny on him,â€ cried the infuriated goddess. â€e shall never
have a wife of the people of this earth.â€ â€e shall have a wife in spite
of you,â€ said Gwydion.

o Gwydion went to Mth, his uncle and tutor in magic, and between them
they made a woman out of flowers by charms and illusion. â€hey took the
blossoms of the oak, and the blossoms of the broom, and the blossoms of
the meadowsweet, and produced from them a maiden, the fairest and most
graceful that man ever saw.â€ hey called her lodeuwedd lowerface,
and gave her to leu as his wife. And they gave leu a palace called Mur
y Castell, near ala ake.

All went well until, one day, Gronw ebyr, one of the gods of darkness,
came by, hunting, and killed the stag at nightfall near leuâ€s castle.
he sungod was away upon a visit to Mth, but lodeuwedd asked the
stranger to take shelter with her. hat night they fell in love with one
another, and conspired together how leu might be put away. When leu
came back from Mthâ€s court, lodeuwedd, like a Celtic alilah, wormed
out of him the secret of how his life was preserved. e told her that he
could only die in one way he could not be killed either inside or
outside a house, either on horseback or on foot, but that if a spear
that had been a year in the making, and which was never worked upon
except during the sacrifice on unday, were to be cast at him as he
stood beneath a roof of thatch, after having ust bathed, with one foot
upon the edge of the bath and the other upon a buck goatâ€s back, it
would cause his death. lodeuwedd piously thanked eaven that he was so
well protected, and sent a messenger to her paramour, telling him what
she had learned. Gronw set to work on the spear and in a year it was
ready. When she knew this, lodeuwedd asked leu to show her exactly how
it was he could be killed.

leu agreed and lodeuwedd prepared the bath under the thatched roof,
and tethered the goat by it. leu bathed, and then stood with one foot
upon the edge of the bath, and the other upon the goatâ€s back. At this
moment, Gronw, from an ambush, flung the spear, and hit leu, who, with
a terrible cry, changed into an eagle, and flew away. e never came
back and Gronw took possession of both his wife and his palace.

ut Gwydion set out to search everywhere for his son. At last, one day,
he came to a house in orth Wales where the man was in great anxiety
about his sow for as soon as the sty was opened, every morning, she
rushed out, and did not return again till late in the evening. Gwydion
offered to follow her, and, at dawn, the man took him to the sty, and
opened the door. he sow leaped forth, and ran, and Gwydion ran after
her. e tracked her to a brook between nowdon and the sea, still called
ant y lew, and saw her feeding underneath an oak. pon the top of the
tree there was an eagle, and, every time it shook itself, there fell off
it lumps of putrid meat, which the sow ate greedily. Gwydion suspected
that the eagle must be leu. o he sang this verse

  â€ak that grows between the two banks
   arkened is the sky and hill
   hall I not tell him by his wounds,
   hat this is leuâ€

he eagle, on hearing this, came halfway down the tree. o Gwydion
sang

  â€ak that grows in upland ground,
   Is it not wetted by the rain as it not been drenched
   y nine score tempests
   It bears in its branches leu law Gyffes.â€

he eagle came slowly down until it was on the lowest branch. Gwydion
sang

  â€ak that grows beneath the steep
   tately and maestic is its aspect
   hall I not speak it
   hat leu will come to my lapâ€

hen the eagle came down, and sat on Gwydionâ€s knee. Gwydion struck it
with his magic wand, and it became leu again, wasted to skin and bone
by the poison on the spear.

Gwydion took him to Mth to be healed, and left him there, while he went
to Mur y Castell, where lodeuwedd was. When she heard that he was
coming, she fled. ut Gwydion overtook her, and changed her into an owl,
the bird that hates the day. A still older form of this probably
extremely ancient myth of the sungodâ€”the savage and repulsive details
of which speak of a hoary antiuityâ€”makes the chase of lodeuwedd by
Gwydion to have taken place in the sky, the stars scattered over the
Milky Way being the traces of it.0 As for her accomplice, leu would
accept no satisfaction short of Gronwâ€s submitting to stand exactly
where leu had stood, to be shot at in his turn. o this he was obliged
to agree and leu killed him.0

here are two other sons of eli and n of whom so little is recorded
that it would hardly be worth while mentioning them, were it not for the
wild poetry of the legend connected with them. he tale, put into
writing at a time when all the gods were being transfigured into simple
mortals, tells us that they were two kings of ritain, brothers. ne
starlight night they were walking together. â€ee,â€ said ynniaw to
eibaw, â€what a fine, widespreading field I have.â€ â€Where is itâ€ asked
eibaw. â€here,â€ replied ynniaw â€the whole stretch of the sky, as far
as the eye reaches.â€ â€ook then,â€ returned eibaw, â€what a number of
cattle I have grazing on your field.â€ â€Where are theyâ€ asked ynniaw.
â€All the stars that you can see,â€ replied eibaw, â€every one of them of
fierycoloured gold, with the moon for a shepherd over them.â€ â€hey
shall not feed on my field,â€ cried ynniaw. â€hey shall,â€ exclaimed
eibaw. â€hey shall not,â€ cried ynniaw, â€hey shall,â€ said eibaw.
â€hey shall not,â€ ynniaw answered and so they went on, from
contradiction to uarrel, and from private uarrel to civil war, until
the armies of both of them were destroyed, and the two authors of the
evil were turned by God into oxen for their sins.0

ast of the children of n, we find a goddess called enardun, of whom
little is known except that she was married to the seagod lyr. his
incident is curious, as forming a parallel to the Gaelic story which
tells of intermarriage between the uatha  anann and the omors.
rigit, the agdaâ€s daughter, was married to ress, son of lathan,
while Cian, the son of iancecht, wedded thniu, the daughter of alor.
o, in this kindred mythology, a slender tie of relationship binds the
gods of the sky to the gods of the sea.

he name lyr is supposed, like its Irish euivalent r, to have
meant â€the eaâ€.2 he ritish seagod is undoubtedly the same as the
Gaelic indeed, the two facts that he is described in Welsh literature
as lyr lediath, that is, â€lyr of the oreign ialectâ€, and is given a
wife called Iweridd Ireland, suggest that he may have been
borrowed by the ritons from the Gaels later than any mythology common
to both. As a ritish god, he was the faroff original of hakespeareâ€s
â€ing earâ€. he chief city of his worship is still called after him,
eicester, that is, lyrcestre, in still earlier days, Caer lyr.

lyr, we have noticed, married two wives, enardun and Iweridd. y the
daughter of n he had a son called Manawyddan, who is identical with
the Gaelic Manannn mac ir. We know less of his character and
attributes than we do of the Irish god but we find him eually a ruler
in that ades or lysium which the Celtic mind ever connected with the
sea. ike all the inhabitants of that other world, he is at once a
master of magic and of the useful arts, which he taught willingly to his
friends. o his enemies, however, he could show a different side of his
character. A triad tells us thatâ€”

  â€he achievement of Manawyddan the Wise,
   After lamentation and fiery wrath,
   Was the constructing of the bonefortress of eth and Anoethâ€,

which is described as a prison made, in the shape of a beehive,
entirely of human bones mortared together, and divided into innumerable
cells, forming a kind of labyrinth. In this ghastly place he immured
those whom he found trespassing in ades and among his captives was no
less a person than the famous Arthur.

â€Irelandâ€ bore two children to lyr a daughter called ranwen and a son
called rn. he little we know of ranwen of the â€air osomâ€ shows her
as a goddess of loveâ€”child, like the Greek Aphrodit, of the sea. rn,
on the other hand, is, even more clearly than Manawyddan, a dark deity
of ades. e is represented as of colossal size, so huge, in fact, that
no house or ship was big enough to hold him. e delighted in battle
and carnage, like the hoodiecrow or raven from which he probably took
his name, but he was also the especial patron of bards, minstrels,
and musicians, and we find him in one of the poems ascribed to aliesin
claiming to be himself a bard, a harper, a player on the crowth, and
sevenscore other musicians all at once. is son was called
Caradawc the trongarmed, who, as the ritish mythology crumbled,
became confounded with the historical Caratacus, known popularly as
â€Caractacusâ€.

oth rn and Manawyddan were especially connected with the wansea
peninsula. he bonefortress of eth and Anoeth was placed by tradition
in Gower.20 hat rn was eually at home there may be proved from
the Morte arthur, in which storehouse of forgotten and misunderstood
mythology rn of Gower survives as â€ing randegoreâ€.2

uch identification of a mere mortal country with the other world seems
strange enough to us, but to our Celtic ancestors it was a uite natural
thought. All islandsâ€”and peninsulas, which, viewed from an opposite
coast, probably seemed to them islandsâ€”were deemed to be preeminently
homes of the dark owers of ades. ifficult of access, protected by the
turbulent and dangerous sea, sometimes rendered uite invisible by fogs
and mists and, at other times, looming up ghostlily on the horizon,
often held by the remnant of a hostile lower race, they gained a mystery
and a sanctity from the law of the human mind which has always held the
unknown to be the terrible. he Cornish ritons, gazing from the shore,
saw Gower and undy, and deemed them outposts of the oversea ther
World. o the ritons of Wales, Ireland was no human realm, a view
reciprocated by the Gaels, who saw ades in ritain, while the Isle of
Man was a little ades common to them both. or even was the sea always
necessary to sunder the world of ghosts from that of â€shadowcasting
menâ€. Glastonbury or, surrounded by almost impassable swamps, was one
of the especial haunts of Gwyn ap udd. he ritons of the north held
that beyond the oman wall and the vast Caledonian wood lived ghosts and
not men. ven the oman province of emetiaâ€”called by the Welsh yfed,
and corresponding, roughly, to the modern County of embrokeshireâ€”was,
as a last stronghold of the aborigines, identified with the mythic
underworld.

As such, yfed was ruled by a local tribe of gods, whose greatest
figures were wyll, â€ead of Annwnâ€ the Welsh name for ades, with his
wife hiannon, and their son ryderi. hese beings are described as
hostile to the children of n, but friendly to the race of lyr. After
wyllâ€s death or disappearance, his widow hiannon becomes the wife of
Manawyddan.22 In a poem of aliesinâ€s we find Manawyddan and ryderi
ointrulers of ades, and warders of that magic cauldron of
inspiration2 which the gods of light attempted to steal or capture,
and which became famous afterwards as the â€oly Grailâ€. Another of their
treasures were the â€hree irds of hiannonâ€, which, we are told in an
ancient book, could sing the dead to life and the living into the sleep
of death. ortunately they sang seldom. â€here are three things,â€ says a
Welsh triad, â€which are not often heard the song of the birds of
hiannon, a song of wisdom from the mouth of a axon, and an invitation
to a feast from a miser.â€

or is the list of ritish gods complete without mention of Arthur,
though most readers will be surprised to find him in such company. he
genius of ennyson, who drew his materials mostly from the ormanrench
romances, has stereotyped the popular conception of Arthur as a king of
early ritain who fought for his fatherland and the Christian faith
against invading axons. ossibly there may, indeed, have been a
powerful ritish chieftain bearing that typically Celtic name, which is
found in Irish legend as Artur, one of the sons of emed who fought
against the omors, and on the Continent as Artaius, a Gaulish deity
whom the omans identified with Mercury, and who seems to have been a
patron of agriculture.2 ut the original Arthur stands upon the same
ground as Cuchulainn and inn. is deeds are mythical, because
superhuman. is companions can be shown to have been divine. ome we
know were worshipped in Gaul. thers are children of n, of lyr, and
of wyll, dynasties of older gods to whose head Arthur seems to have
risen, as his cult waxed and theirs waned. tripped of their godhead,
and strangely transformed, they fill the pages of romance as nights of
the able ound.

hese deities were the native gods of ritain. Many others are, however,
mentioned upon inscriptions found in our island, but these were almost
all exotic and imported. Imperial ome brought men of diverse races
among her legions, and these men brought their gods. cattered over
ritain, but especially in the north, near the Wall, we find evidence
that deities of many nationsâ€”from Germany to Africa, and from Gaul to
ersiaâ€”were sporadically worshipped.2 Most of these foreign gods
were oman, but a temple at boracum now York was dedicated to
erapis, and Mithras, the ersian sungod, was also adored there while
at Corbridge, in orthumberland the ancient Corspitium, there have
been found altars to the yrian ercules and to Astarte. he wargod was
also invoked under many strange namesâ€”as â€Cocidiusâ€ by a colony of
acians in Cumberland as outates, Camulus, Coritiacus, elatucador,
Alator, oucetius, Condates, and igisamos by men of different
countries. A goddess of war was worshipped at ath under the name of
emetona. he hot springs of the same town were under the patronage of a
divinity called ul, identified by the omans with Minerva, and she was
helped by a god of medicine described on a dedicatory tablet as â€ol
Apollo Anicetusâ€. ew of these â€strange godsâ€, however, seem to have
taken hold of the imagination of the native ritons. heir worshippers
did not proselytize, and their general influence was probably about
eual to that of an vangelical Church in a urkish town. he sole
exceptions to this rule are where the foreign gods are Gaulish but in
several instances it can be proved that they were not so much of oman,
as of original Celtic importation. he warlike heavengod Camulus
appears in Gaelic heroic myth as Cumhal, the father of inn, and in
ritish mythical history as Coel, a duke of Caer Coelvin known earlier
as Camulodunum, and now as Colchester, who seized the crown of ritain,
and spent his short reign in a series of battles.2 he name of the
sungod Maponos is found alike upon altars in Gaul and ritain, and in
Welsh literature as Mabon, a follower of Arthur while another Gaulish
sungod, elinus, who had a splendid temple at aocassos the modern
ayeux, though not mentioned in the earliest ritish mythology, as its
scattered records have come down to us, must have been connected with
rn, for we find in Geoffrey of Monmouthâ€s istory â€ing elinusâ€ as
brother of â€ing renniusâ€,2 and in the Morte arthur â€alinâ€ as
brother of â€alanâ€.2 A secondcentury Greek writer gives an account
of a god of elouence worshipped in Gaul under the name of gmios, and
represented as euipped like eracles, a description which exactly
corresponds to the conception of the Gaelic gma, at once patron of
literature and writing and professional strong man of the uatha 
anann. emetona, the wargoddess worshipped at ath, was probably the
same as emon, one of uadaâ€s alkyrwives, while a broken inscription
to athubodva, which probably stood, when intact, for Cathubodva, may
well have been addressed to the Gaulish euivalent of adb Catha, the
â€Warfuryâ€. ugh, or leu, was also widely known on the Continent as
ugus. hree important townsâ€”aon, eyden, and yonsâ€”were all anciently
called after him ugudunum ugusâ€ town, and at the last and
greatest of these a festival was still held in oman times upon the
sungodâ€s dayâ€”the first of Augustâ€”which corresponded to the ugnassad
ughâ€s commemoration held in ancient Ireland. rigit, the Gaelic
Minerva, is also found in ritain as rigantia, tutelary goddess of the
rigantes, a orthern tribe, and in astern rance as rigindo, to whom
Iccavos, son of ppianos, made a dedicatory offering of which there is
still record.2

ther, less striking agreements between the mythical divine names of the
Insular and Continental Celts might be cited. hese recorded should,
however, prove sufficiently that Gaul, Gael, and riton shared in a
common heritage of mythological names and ideas, which they separately
developed into three superficially different, but essentially similar
cults.

                              CA II

                   A   G  A


It is with the family of wyll, deities connected with the southwest
corner of Wales, called by the omans emetia, and by the ritons yfed,
and, roughly speaking, identical with the modern county of
embrokeshire, that the earliest consecutive accounts of the ritish
gods begin. he first of the our ranches of the Mabinogi tell us how
â€wyll, rince of yfedâ€, gained the right to be called en Annwn, the
â€ead of adesâ€. Indeed, it almost seems as if it had been deliberately
written to explain how the same person could be at once a mere mortal
prince, however legendary, and a ruler in the mystic ther World, and so
to reconcile two conflicting traditions.0 ut to an earlier age than
that in which the legend was put into a literary shape, such forced
reconciliation would not have been needed for the two legends would not
have been considered to conflict. When wyll, head of Annwn, was a
mythic person whose tradition was still alive, the unexplored, rugged,
and savage country of yfed, populated by the aboriginal Iberians whom
the Celt had driven into such remote districts, appeared to those who
dwelt upon the eastern side of its dividing river, the aw, at least a
dependency of Annwn, if not that weird realm itself. ut, as men grew
bolder, the frontier was crossed, and yfed entered and traversed, and
found to be not so unlike other countries. Its inhabitants, if not of
Celtic race, were yet of flesh and blood. o that, though the province
still continued to bear to a late date the names of the â€and of
Illusionâ€ and the â€ealm of Glamourâ€, it was no longer deemed to be
ades itself. hat fitful and shadowy country had folded its tents, and
departed over or under seas.

he story of â€wyll, rince of yfedâ€,2 tells us how there was war
in Annwn between its two kingsâ€”or between two, perhaps, of its many
chieftains. Arawn â€ilverongueâ€ and avgan â€ummerWhiteâ€ each
coveted the dominions of the other. In the continual contests between
them, Arawn was worsted, and in despair he visited the upper earth to
seek for a mortal ally.

At this time wyll, rince of yfed, held his court at arberth. e had,
however, left his capital upon a hunting expedition to Glyn Cch, known
today as a valley upon the borders of the two counties of embroke and
Carmarthen. ike so many kings of uropean and riental romance, when an
adventure is at hand, he became separated from his party, and was, in
modern parlance, â€thrown outâ€. e could, however, still hear the music
of his hounds, and was listening to them, when he also distinguished the
cry of another pack coming towards him. As he watched and listened, a
stag came into view and the strange hounds pulled it down almost at his
feet. At first wyll hardly looked at the stag, he was so taken up with
gazing at the hounds, for â€of all the hounds that he had seen in the
world, he had never seen any that were like unto these. or their hair
was of a brilliant shining white, and their ears were red and as the
whiteness of their bodies shone, so did the redness of their ears
glisten.â€ hey were, indeed, though wyll does not seem to have known
it, of the true ades breedâ€”the snowwhite, redeared hounds we meet in
Gaelic legends, and which are still said to be sometimes heard and seen
scouring the hills of Wales by night. eeing no rider with the hounds,
wyll drove them away from the dead stag, and called up his own pack to
it.

While he was doing this, a man â€upon a large, lightgray steed, with a
huntinghorn round his neck, and clad in garments of gray woollen in the
fashion of a hunting garbâ€ appeared, and rated wyll for his
unsportsmanlike conduct. â€Greater discourtesy,â€ said he, â€I never saw
than your driving away my dogs after they had killed the stag, and
calling your own to it. And though I may not be revenged upon you for
this, I swear that I will do you more damage than the value of a hundred
stags.â€

wyll expressed his contrition, and, asking the newcomerâ€s name and
rank, offered to atone for his fault. he stranger told his nameâ€”Arawn,
a king of Annwnâ€”and said that wyll could gain his forgiveness only in
one way, by going to Annwn instead of him, and fighting for him with
avgan. wyll agreed to do this, and the ing of ades put his own
semblance upon the mortal prince, so that not a person in Annwnâ€”not even
Arawnâ€s own wifeâ€”would know that he was not that king. e led him by a
secret path into Annwn, and left him before his castle, charging him to
return to the place where they had first met, at the end of a year from
that day. n the other hand, Arawn took on wyllâ€s shape, and went to
arberth.

o one in Annwn suspected wyll of being anyone else than their king. e
spent the year in ruling the realm, in hunting, minstrelsy, and
feasting. oth by day and night, he had the company of Arawnâ€s wife, the
most beautiful woman he had ever yet seen, but he refrained from taking
advantage of the trust placed in him. At last the day came when he was
to meet avgan in single combat. ne blow settled it for wyll,
avganâ€s destined conueror, thrust his antagonist an armâ€s and a
spearâ€s length over the crupper of his horse, breaking his shield and
armour, and mortally wounding him. avgan was carried away to die, and
wyll, in the guise of Arawn, received the submission of the dead kingâ€s
subects, and annexed his realm. hen he went back to Glyn Cch, to keep
his tryst with Arawn.

hey retook their own shapes, and each returned to his own kingdom.
wyll learned that yfed had never been ruled so well, or been so
prosperous, as during the year ust passed. As for the ing of ades, he
found his enemy gone, and his domains extended. And when he caressed his
wife, she asked him why he did so now, after the lapse of a whole year.
o he told her the truth, and they both agreed that they had indeed got
a true friend in wyll.

After this, the kings of Annwn and yfed made their friendship strong
between them. rom that time forward, says the story, wyll was no
longer called rince of yfed, but en Annwn, â€the ead of adesâ€.

he second mythological incident in the Mabinogi of wyll, rince of
yfed, tells how the ead of ades won his wife, hiannon, thought by
rofessor hys to have been a goddess either of the dawn or of the
moon. here was a mound outside wyllâ€s palace at arberth which
had a magical uality. o anyone who sat upon it there happened one of
two things either he received wounds and blows, or else he saw a
wonder. ne day, it occurred to wyll that he would like to try the
experience of the mound. o he went and sat upon it.

o unseen blows assailed wyll, but he had not been sitting long upon
the mound before he saw, coming towards him, â€a lady on a purewhite
horse of large size, with a garment of shining gold around herâ€, riding
very uietly. e sent a man on foot to ask her who she was, but, though
she seemed to be moving so slowly, the man could not come up to her. e
failed utterly to overtake her, and she passed on out of sight.

he next day, wyll went again to the mound. he lady appeared, and,
this time, wyll sent a horseman. At first, the horseman only ambled
along at about the same pace at which the lady seemed to be going then,
failing to get near her, he urged his horse into a gallop. ut, whether
he rode slow or fast, he could come no closer to the lady than before,
although she seemed to the eyes of those who watched to have been going
only at a footâ€s pace.

he day after that, wyll determined to accost the lady himself. he
came at the same gentle walk, and wyll at first rode easily, and then
at his horseâ€s topmost speed, but with the same result, or lack of it.
At last, in despair, he called to the mysterious damsel to stop. â€I will
stop gladly,â€ said she, â€and it would have been better for your horse if
you had asked me before.â€ he told him that her name was hiannon,
daughter of eveydd the Ancient. he nobles of her realm had determined
to give her in marriage against her will, so she had come to seek out
wyll, who was the man of her choice. wyll was delighted to hear this,
for he thought that she was the most beautiful lady he had ever seen.
efore they parted, they had plighted troth, and wyll had promised to
appear on that day twelvemonth at the palace of her father, eveydd.
hen she vanished, and wyll returned to arberth.

At the appointed time, wyll went to visit eveydd the Ancient, with a
hundred followers. e was received with much welcome, and the
disposition of the feast put under his command, as the Celts seem to
have done to especially honoured guests. As they sat at meat, with wyll
between hiannon and her father, a tall auburnhaired youth came into
the hall, greeted wyll, and asked a boon of him. â€Whatever boon you may
ask of me,â€ said wyll thoughtlessly, â€if it is in my power, you shall
have it.â€ hen the suitor threw off all disguise, called the guests to
witness wyllâ€s promise, and claimed hiannon as his bride. wyll was
dumb. â€e silent as long as you will,â€ said the masterful hiannon
â€never did a man make worse use of his wits than you have done.â€ â€ady,â€
replied the amazed wyll, â€I knew not who he was.â€ â€e is the man to
whom they would have given me against my will,â€ she answered, â€Gwawl,
the son of Cld. You must bestow me upon him now, lest shame befall
you.â€ â€ever will I do that,â€ said wyll. â€estow me upon him,â€ she
insisted, â€and I will cause that I shall never be his.â€ o wyll
promised Gwawl that he would make a feast that day year, at which he
would resign hiannon to him.

he next year, the feast was made, and hiannon sat by the side of her
unwelcome bridegroom. ut wyll was waiting outside the palace, with a
hundred men in ambush. When the banuet was at its height, he came into
the hall, dressed in coarse, ragged garments, shod with clumsy old
shoes, and carrying a leather bag. ut the bag was a magic one, which
hiannon had given to her lover, with directions as to its use. Its
uality was that, however much was put into it, it could never be
filled. â€I crave a boon,â€ he said to Gwawl. â€What is itâ€ Gwawl replied.
â€I am a poor man, and all I ask is to have this bag filled with meat.â€
Gwawl granted what he said was â€a reuest within reasonâ€, and ordered
his followers to fill the bag. ut the more they put into it, the more
room in it there seemed to be. Gwawl was astonished, and asked why this
was. wyll replied that it was a bag that could never be filled until
someone possessed of lands and riches should tread the food down with
both his feet. â€o this for the man,â€ said hiannon to Gwawl. â€Gladly I
will,â€ replied he, and put both his feet into the bag. ut no sooner had
he done so than wyll slipped the bag over Gwawlâ€s head, and tied it up
at the mouth. e blew his horn, and all his followers came in. â€What
have you got in the bagâ€ asked each one in turn. â€A badger,â€ replied
wyll. hen each, as he received wyllâ€s answer, kicked the bag, or hit
it with a stick. â€hen,â€ says the story, â€was the game of â€adger in the
agâ€ first played.â€

Gwawl, however, fared better than we suspect that the badger usually
did for eveydd the Ancient interceded for him. wyll willingly
released him, on condition that he promised to give up all claim to
hiannon, and renounced all proects of revenge. Gwawl consented, and
gave sureties, and went away to his own country to have his bruises
healed.

his country of Gwawlâ€s was, no doubt, the sky for he was evidently a
sungod. is name bewrays him for the meaning of â€Gwawlâ€ is
â€lightâ€. It was one of the hours of victory for the dark powers,
such as were celebrated in the Celtic calendar by the east of amhain,
or ummer nd.

here was no hindrance now to the marriage of wyll and hiannon. he
became his bride, and returned with him to yfed.

or three years, they were without an heir, and the nobles of yfed
became discontented. hey petitioned wyll to take another wife instead
of hiannon. e asked for a yearâ€s delay. his was granted, and, before
the end of the year, a son was born. ut, on the night of his birth, the
six women set to keep watch over hiannon all fell asleep at once and
when they woke up, the boy had vanished. earful lest their lives should
be forfeited for their neglect, they agreed to swear that hiannon had
eaten her child. hey killed a litter of puppies, and smeared some of
the blood on hiannonâ€s face and hands, and put some of the bones by her
side. hen they awoke her with a great outcry, and accused her. he
swore that she knew nothing of the death of her son, but the women
persisted that they had seen her devour him, and had been unable to
prevent it. he druids of that day were not sufficiently practical
anatomists to be able to tell the bones of a child from those of a dog,
so they condemned hiannon upon the evidence of the women. ut, even
now, wyll would not put her away so she was assigned a penance. or
seven years, she was to sit by a horseblock outside the gate, and offer
to carry visitors into the palace upon her back. â€ut it rarely
happened,â€ says the Mabinogi, â€that any would permit her to do so.â€

xactly what had become of hiannonâ€s child seems to have been a mystery
even to the writer of the Mabinogi. It was, at any rate, in some way
connected with the eually mysterious disappearance on every night of
the first of Mayâ€”eltaine, the Celtic sunfestivalâ€”of the colts foaled
by a beautiful mare belonging to eirnyon wryv liant, one of wyllâ€s
vassals. very Mayday night, the mare foaled, but no one knew what
became of the colt. eirnyon decided to find out. e caused the mare to
be taken into a house, and there he watched it, fully armed. arly in
the night, the colt was born. hen there was a great noise, and an arm
with claws came through the window, and gripped the coltâ€s mane.
eirnyon hacked at the arm with his sword, and cut it off. hen he heard
wailing, and opened the door, and found a baby in swaddling clothes,
wrapped in a satin mantle. e took it up and brought it to his wife, and
they decided to adopt it. hey called the boy Gwri Wallt uryn, that is
â€Gwri of the Golden airâ€.

he older the boy grew, the more it seemed to eirnyon that he became
like wyll. hen he remembered that he had found him upon the very night
that hiannon lost her child. o he consulted with his wife, and they
both agreed that the baby they had so mysteriously found must be the
same that hiannon had so mysteriously lost. And they decided that it
would not be right for them to keep the son of another, while so good a
lady as hiannon was being punished wrongfully.

o, the very next day, eirnyon set out for arberth, taking the boy
with him. hey found hiannon sitting, as usual, by the gate, but they
would not allow her to carry them into the palace on her back. wyll
welcomed them and that evening, as they sat at supper, eirnyon told
his hosts the story from beginning to end. And he presented her son to
hiannon.

As soon as everyone in the palace saw the boy, they admitted that he
must be wyllâ€s son. o they adopted him with delight and endaran
yfed, the head druid of the kingdom, gave him a new name. e called him
â€ryderiâ€, meaning â€troubleâ€, from the first word that his mother
had uttered when he was restored to her. or she had said â€rouble
is, indeed, at an end for me, if this be trueâ€.

                         AIG  


In the second of the â€our ranchesâ€, ryderi, come to manâ€s estate, and
married to a wife called icva, appears as a guest or vassal at the
court of a greater god of ades than himselfâ€”rn, the son of the
seagod lyr. he children of lyrâ€”rn, with his sister ranwen of the
â€air osomâ€ and his halfbrother Manawyddan, as well as two sons of
Manawyddanâ€s mother, enardun, by an earlier marriage, were holding
court at wr ranwen, â€ranwenâ€s owerâ€, now called arlech. As they
sat on a cliff, looking over the sea, they saw thirteen ships coming
from Ireland. he fleet sailed close under the land, and rn sent
messengers to ask who they were, and why they had come. It was replied
that they were the vessels of Matholwch, ing of Ireland, and that he
had come to ask rn for his sister ranwen in marriage. rn consented,
and they fixed upon Aberffraw, in Anglesey, as the place at which to
hold the wedding feast. Matholwch and his fleet went there by sea, and
rn and his host by land. When they arrived, and met, they set up
pavilions for â€no house could ever hold the blessed rnâ€. And there
ranwen became the ing of Irelandâ€s bride.

hese relations were not long, however, allowed to be friendly. f the
two other sons of lyrâ€s wife, enardun, the mother of Manawyddan, one
was called issyen, and the other, vnissyen. issyen was a lover of
peace, and would always â€cause his family to be friends when their wrath
was at the highestâ€, but vnissyen â€would cause strife between his two
brothers when they were most at peaceâ€. ow vnissyen was enraged
because his consent had not been asked to ranwenâ€s marriage. ut of
spite at this, he cut off the lips, ears, eyebrows, and tails of all
Matholwchâ€s horses.

When the ing of Ireland found this out, he was very indignant at the
insult. ut rn sent an embassy to him twice, explaining that it had
not been done by his consent or with his knowledge. e appeased
Matholwch by giving him a sound horse in place of every one that
vnissyen had mutilated, as well as a staff of silver as large and tall
as Matholwch himself, and a plate of gold as broad as Matholwchâ€s face.
o these gifts he also added a magic cauldron brought from Ireland. Its
property was that any slain man who was put into it was brought to life
again, except that he lost the use of speech. he ing of Ireland
accepted this recompense for the insult done him, renewed his friendship
with the children of lyr, and sailed away with ranwen to Ireland.

efore a year was over, ranwen bore a son. hey called him Gwern, and
put him out to be fosternursed among the best men of Ireland. ut,
during the second year, news came to Ireland of the insult that
Matholwch had received in ritain. he ing of Irelandâ€s fosterbrothers
and near relations insisted that he should revenge himself upon ranwen.
o the ueen was compelled to serve in the kitchen, and, every day, the
butcher gave her a box upon the ear. hat this should not become known
to rn, all traffic was forbidden between Ireland and ritain. his
went on for three years.

ut, in the meantime, ranwen had reared a tame starling, and she taught
it to speak, and tied a letter of complaint to the root of its wing, and
sent it off to ritain. At last it found rn, whom its mistress had
described to it, and settled upon his shoulder, ruffling its wings. his
exposed the letter, and rn read it. e sent messengers to one hundred
and fortyfour countries, to raise an army to go to Ireland. eaving his
son Caradawc, with seven others, in charge of ritain, he
startedâ€”himself wading through the sea, while his men went by ship.

o one in Ireland knew that they were coming until the royal swineherds,
tending their pigs near the seashore, beheld a marvel. hey saw a
forest on the surface of the seaâ€”a place where certainly no forest had
been beforeâ€”and, near it, a mountain with a lofty ridge on its top, and
a lake on each side of the ridge. oth the forest and the mountain were
swiftly moving towards Ireland. hey informed Matholwch, who could not
understand it, and sent messengers to ask ranwen what she thought it
might be. â€It is the men of the Island of the Mighty,â€ said she,
â€who are coming here because they have heard of my illtreatment. he
forest that is seen on the sea is made of the masts of ships. he
mountain is my brother rn, wading into shoal water the lofty ridge is
his nose, and the two lakes, one on each side of it, are his eyes.â€

he men of Ireland were terrified. hey fled beyond the hannon, and
broke down the bridge over it. ut rn lay down across the river, and
his army walked over him to the opposite side.

Matholwch now sent messengers suing for peace. e offered to resign the
throne of Ireland to Gwern, ranwenâ€s son and rnâ€s nephew. â€hall I
not have the kingdom myselfâ€ said rn, and would not hear of anything
else. o the counsellors of Matholwch advised him to conciliate rn by
building him a house so large that it would be the first house that had
ever held him, and, in it, to hand over the kingdom to his will. rn
consented to accept this, and the vast house was built.

It concealed treachery. pon each side of the hundred pillars of the
house was hung a bag, and in the bag was an armed man, who was to cut
himself out at a given signal. ut vnissyen came into the house, and
seeing the bags there, suspected the plot. â€What is in this bagâ€ he
said to one of the Irish, as he came up to the first one. â€Meal,â€
replied the Irishman. hen vnissyen kneaded the bag in his hands, as
though it really contained meal, until he had killed the man inside and
he treated all of them in turn in the same way.

A little later, the two hosts met in the house. he men of Ireland came
in on one side, and the men of ritain on the other, and met at the
hearth in the middle, and sat down. he Irish court did homage to rn,
and they crowned Gwern, ranwenâ€s son, ing of Ireland in place of
Matholwch. When the ceremonies were over, the boy went from one to
another of his uncles, to make acuaintance with them. rn fondled and
caressed him, and so did Manawyddan, and issyen. ut when he came to
vnissyen, the wicked son of enardun seized the child by the feet, and
dropped him head first into the great fire.

When ranwen saw her son killed, she tried to leap into the flames after
him, but rn held her back. hen every man armed himself, and such a
tumult was never heard in one house before. ay after day they fought
but the Irish had the advantage, for they had only to plunge their dead
men into the magic cauldron to bring them back to life. When vnissyen
knew this, he saw a way of atoning for the misfortunes his evil nature
had brought upon ritain. e disguised himself as an Irishman, and lay
upon the floor as if dead, until they put him into the cauldron. hen he
stretched himself, and, with one desperate effort, burst both the
cauldron and his own heart.

hus things were made eual again, and in the next battle the men of
ritain killed all the Irish. ut of themselves there were only seven
left unhurtâ€”ryderi Manawyddan Gluneu, the son of aran aliesin
the ard Ynawc Grudyen, the son of Muryel and eilyn, the son of
Gwynn the Ancient.

rn himself was wounded in the foot with a poisoned dart, and was in
agony. o he ordered his seven surviving followers to cut off his head,
and to take it to the White Mount in ondon0, and bury it there,
with the face towards rance. e prophesied how they would perform the
ourney. At arlech they would be feasting seven years, the birds of
hiannon singing to them all the time, and rnâ€s own head conversing
with them as agreeably as when it was on his body. hen they would be
fourscore years at Gwales. All this while, rnâ€s head would remain
uncorrupted, and would talk so pleasantly that they would forget the
flight of time. ut, at the destined hour, someone would open a door
which looked towards Cornwall, and, after that, they could stay no
longer, but must hurry to ondon to bury the head.

o the seven beheaded rn, and set off, taking ranwen also with them.
hey landed at the mouth of the iver Alaw, in Anglesey. ranwen first
looked back towards Ireland, and then forward towards ritain. â€Alas,â€
she cried, â€that I was ever born two islands have been destroyed
because of me.â€ er heart broke with sorrow, and she died. An old Welsh
poem says, with a touch of real pathos

                â€oftened were the voices in the brakes
                 f the wondering birds
                 n seeing the fair body.
                 Will there not be relating again
                 f that which befel the paragon
                 At the stream of Amlwchâ€2

â€hey made her a foursided grave,â€ says the Mabinogi, â€and buried her
upon the banks of the Alaw.â€ he traditionary spot has always borne the
name of Ynys ranwen, and, curiously enough, an urn was found there,
in , full of ashes and halfburnt bones, which certain enthusiastic
local antiuaries saw â€every reason to supposeâ€ were those of the fair
ritish Aphrodit herself.

he seven went on towards arlech, and, as they ourneyed, they met men
and women who gave them the latest news. Caswallawn, a son of eli, the
husband of n, had destroyed the ministers left behind by rn to take
care of ritain. e had made himself invisible by the help of a magic
veil, and thus had killed all of them except endaran yfed,
fosterfather of ryderi, who had escaped into the woods, and Caradawc
son of rn, whose heart had broken from grief. hus he had made himself
king of the whole island in place of Manawyddan, its rightful heir now
that rn was dead.

owever, the destiny was upon the seven that they should go on with
their leaderâ€s head. hey went to arlech and feasted for seven years,
the three birds of hiannon singing them songs compared with which all
other songs seemed unmelodious. hen they spent fourscore years in the
Isle of Gwales, eating and drinking, and listening to the pleasant
conversation of rnâ€s head. he â€ntertaining of the oble eadâ€ this
eighty yearsâ€ feast was called. rnâ€s head, indeed, is almost more
notable in ritish mythology than rn before he was decapitated.
aliesin and the other bards invoke it repeatedly as rddawl en the
â€enerable eadâ€ and ther en the â€Wonderful eadâ€.

ut all pleasure came to an end when eilyn, the son of Gwynn, opened
the forbidden door, like luebeardâ€s wife, â€to know if that was true
which was said concerning itâ€. As soon as they looked towards Cornwall,
the glamour that had kept them merry for eightyseven years failed, and
left them as grieved about the death of their lord as though it had
happened that very day. hey could not rest for sorrow, but went at once
to ondon, and laid the now dumb and corrupting head in its grave on
ower ill, with its face turned towards rance, to watch that no foe
came from foreign lands to ritain. here it reposed until, ages
afterwards, Arthur, in his pride of heart, dug it up, â€as he thought it
beneath his dignity to hold the island otherwise than by valourâ€.
isaster, in the shape of

                            â€the godless hosts
            f heathen swarming oâ€er the orthern seaâ€,

came of this disinterment and therefore it is called, in a triad, one
of the â€hree Wicked ncoverings of ritainâ€.

Manawyddan was now the sole survivor of the family of lyr. e was
homeless and landless. ut ryderi offered to give him a realm in yfed,
and his mother, hiannon, for a wife. he lady, her son explained, was
still not uncomely, and her conversation was pleasing. Manawyddan seems
to have found her attractive, while hiannon was not less taken with the
son of lyr. hey were wedded, and so great became the friendship of
ryderi and icva, Manawyddan and hiannon, that the four were seldom
apart.

ne day, after holding a feast at arberth, they went up to the same
magic mound where hiannon had first met wyll. As they sat there,
thunder pealed, and immediately a thick mist sprang up, so that not one
of them could see the other. When it cleared, they found themselves
alone in an uninhabited country. xcept for their own castle, the land
was desert and untilled, without sign of dwelling, man, or beast. ne
touch of some unknown magic had utterly changed the face of yfed from a
rich realm to a wilderness.

Manawyddan and ryderi, hiannon and icva traversed the country on all
sides, but found nothing except desolation and wild beasts. or two
years they lived in the open upon game and honey.

uring the third year, they grew weary of this wild life, and decided to
go into loegyr, and support themselves by some handicraft.
Manawyddan could make saddles, and he made them so well that soon no one
in ereford, where they had settled, would buy from any saddler but
himself. his aroused the enmity of all the other saddlers, and they
conspired to kill the strangers. o the four went to another city.

ere they made shields, and soon no one would purchase a shield unless
it had been made by Manawyddan and ryderi. he shieldmakers became
ealous, and again a move had to be made.

ut they fared no better at the next town, where they practised the
craft of cordwainers, Manawyddan shaping the shoes and ryderi stitching
them. o they went back to yfed again, and occupied themselves in
hunting.

ne day, the hounds of Manawyddan and ryderi roused a white wild boar.
hey chased it till they came to a castle at a place where both the
huntsmen were certain that no castle had been before. Into this castle
went the boar, and the hounds after it. or some time, Manawyddan and
ryderi waited in vain for their return. ryderi then proposed that he
should go into the castle, and see what had become of them. Manawyddan
tried to dissuade him, declaring that whoever their enemy was who had
laid yfed waste had also caused the appearance of this castle. ut
ryderi insisted upon entering.

In the castle, he found neither the boar nor his hounds, nor any trace
of man or beast. here was nothing but a fountain in the centre of the
castle floor, and, on the brink of the fountain, a beautiful golden bowl
fastened to a marble slab by chains.

ryderi was so pleased with the beauty of the bowl that he put out his
hands and took hold of it. Whereupon his hands stuck to the bowl, so
that he could not move from where he stood.

Manawyddan waited for him till the evening, and then returned to the
palace, and told hiannon. he, more daring than her husband, rebuked
him for cowardice, and went straight to the magic castle. In the court
she found ryderi, his hands still glued to the bowl and his feet to the
slab. he tried to free him, but became fixed, herself, and, with a clap
of thunder and a fall of mist, the castle vanished with its two
prisoners.

Manawyddan was now left alone with icva, ryderiâ€s wife. e calmed her
fears, and assured her of his protection. ut they had lost their dogs,
and could not hunt any more, so they set out together to loegyr, to
practise again Manawyddanâ€s old trade of cordwainer. A second time, the
envious cordwainers conspired to kill them, so they were obliged to
return to yfed.

ut Manawyddan took back a burden of wheat with him to arberth, and
sowed three crofts, all of which sprang up abundantly.

When harvest time came, he went to look at his first croft, and found it
ripe. â€I will reap this tomorrow,â€ he said. ut in the morning he found
nothing but the bare straw. very ear had been taken away.

o he went to the next croft, which was also ripe. ut, when he came to
cut it, he found it had been stripped like the first. hen he knew that
whoever had wasted yfed, and carried off hiannon and ryderi, was also
at work upon his wheat.

he third croft was also ripe, and over this one he determined to keep
watch. In the evening he armed himself and waited. At midnight he heard
a great tumult, and, looking out, saw a host of mice coming. ach mouse
bit off an ear of wheat and ran off with it. e rushed among them, but
could only catch one, which was more sluggish than the rest. his one he
put into his glove, and took it back, and showed it to icva.

â€omorrow I will hang it,â€ he said. â€It is not a fit thing for a man of
your dignity to hang a mouse,â€ she replied. â€evertheless will I do so,â€
said he. â€o so then,â€ said icva.

he next morning, Manawyddan went to the magic mound, and set up two
forks on it, to make a gallows. e had ust finished, when a man dressed
like a poor scholar came towards him, and greeted him.

â€What are you doing, ordâ€ he said.

â€I am going to hang a thief,â€ replied Manawyddan.

â€What sort of a thief I see an animal like a mouse in your hand, but a
man of rank like yours should not touch so mean a creature. et it go
free.â€

â€I caught it robbing me,â€ replied Manawyddan, â€and it shall die a
thiefâ€s death.â€

â€I do not care to see a man like you doing such a thing,â€ said the
scholar. â€I will give you a pound to let it go.â€

â€I will not let it go,â€ replied Manawyddan, â€nor will I sell it.â€

â€As you will, ord. It is nothing to me,â€ returned the scholar. And he
went away.

Manawyddan laid a crossbar along the forks. As he did so, another man
came by, a priest riding on a horse. e asked Manawyddan what he was
doing, and was told. â€My lord,â€ he said, â€such a reptile is worth
nothing to buy, but rather than see you degrade yourself by touching it,
I will give you three pounds to let it go.â€

â€I will take no money for it,â€ replied Manawyddan. â€It shall be hanged.â€

â€et it be hanged,â€ said the priest, and went his way.

Manawyddan put the noose round the mouseâ€s neck, and was ust going to
draw it up, when he saw a bishop coming, with his whole retinue.

â€hy blessing, ord ishop,â€ he said.

â€eavenâ€s blessing upon you,â€ said the bishop. â€What are you doingâ€

â€I am hanging a thief,â€ replied Manawyddan. â€his mouse has robbed me.â€

â€ince I happen to have come at its doom, I will ransom it,â€ said the
bishop. â€ere are seven pounds. ake them, and let it go.â€

â€I will not let it go,â€ replied Manawyddan.

â€I will give you twentyfour pounds of ready money if you will let it
go,â€ said the bishop.

â€I would not, for as much again,â€ replied Manawyddan.

â€If you will not free it for that,â€ said the bishop, â€I will give you
all my horses and their baggage to let it go.â€

â€I will not,â€ replied Manawyddan.

â€hen name your own price,â€ said the bishop.

â€hat offer I accept,â€ replied Manawyddan. â€My price is that hiannon
and ryderi be set free.â€

â€hey shall be set free,â€ replied the bishop.

â€till I will not let the mouse go,â€ said Manawyddan.

â€What more do you askâ€ exclaimed the bishop.

â€hat the charm be removed from yfed,â€ replied Manawyddan.

â€It shall be removed,â€ promised the bishop. â€o set the mouse free.â€

â€I will not,â€ said Manawyddan, â€till I know who the mouse is.â€

â€he is my wife,â€ replied the bishop, â€and I am called lwyd, the son of
ilcoed, and I cast the charm over yfed, and upon hiannon and ryderi,
to avenge Gwawl son of Cld for the game of â€badger in the bagâ€ which
was played on him by wyll, ead of Annwn. It was my household that came
in the guise of mice and took away your corn. ut since my wife has been
caught, I will restore hiannon and ryderi and take the charm off yfed
if you will let her go.â€

â€I will not let her go,â€ said Manawyddan, â€until you have promised that
there shall be no charm put upon yfed again.â€

â€I will promise that also,â€ replied lwyd. â€o let her go.â€

â€I will not let her go,â€ said Manawyddan, â€unless you swear to take no
revenge for this hereafter.â€

â€You have done wisely to claim that,â€ replied lwyd. â€Much trouble would
else have come upon your head because of this. ow I swear it. o set my
wife free.â€

â€I will not,â€ said Manawyddan, â€until I see hiannon and ryderi.â€

hen he saw them coming towards him and they greeted one another.

â€ow set my wife free,â€ said the bishop.

â€I will, gladly,â€ replied Manawyddan. o he released the mouse, and
lwyd struck her with a wand, and turned her into â€a young woman, the
fairest ever seenâ€.

And when Manawyddan looked round him, he saw yfed tilled and cultivated
again, as it had formerly been.

he powers of light had, this time, the victory. ittle by little, they
increased their mastery over the dominion of darkness, until we find the
survivors of the families of lyr and wyll mere vassals of Arthur.

he powers of light were, however, by no means invariably successful in
their struggles with the powers of darkness. ven Gwydion son of n had
to serve his apprenticeship to misfortune. Assailing Caer
idiâ€”ades under one of its many titles,â€”he was caught by wyll and
ryderi, and endured a long imprisonment. he sufferings he
underwent made him a bardâ€”an ancient Celtic idea which one can still see
surviving in the popular tradition that whoever dares to spend a night
alone either upon the chair of the Giant Idris the summit of Cader
Idris, in Merionethshire, or under the haunted lack tone of Arddu,
upon the lanberis side of nowdon, will be found in the morning either
inspired or mad. ow he escaped we are not told but the episode
does not seem to have uenched his ardour against the natural enemies of
his kind.

elped by his brother, Amaethon, god of agriculture, and his son, leu,
he fought the attle of Godeu, or â€the reesâ€, an exploit which is not
the least curious of Celtic myths. It is known also as the attle of
Achren, or chren, a name for ades of unknown meaning, but appearing
again in the remarkable Welsh poem which describes the â€poiling of
Annwnâ€ by Arthur. he ing of Achren was Arawn and he was helped by
rn, who apparently had not then made his fatal ourney to Ireland. he
war was made to secure three boons for manâ€”the dog, the deer, and the
lapwing, all of them creatures for some reason sacred to the gods of the
nether world.

Gwydion was this time not alone, as he apparently was when he made his
first unfortunate reconnaissance of ades. esides his brother and his
son, he had an army which he raised for the purpose. or a leader of
Gwydionâ€s magical attainments there was no need of standing troops. e
could call battalions into being with a charm, and dismiss them when
they were no longer needed. he name of the battle shows what he did on
this occasion and the bard aliesin adds his testimony

      â€I have been in the battle of Godeu, with leu and Gwydion,
       hey changed the forms of the elementary trees and sedgesâ€.

In a poem devoted to it0 he describes in detail what happened. he
trees and grasses, he tells us, hurried to the fight the alders led the
van, but the willows and the uickens came late, and the birch, though
courageous, took long in arraying himself the elm stood firm in the
centre of the battle, and would not yield a foot heaven and earth
trembled before the advance of the oaktree, that stout doorkeeper
against an enemy the heroic holly and the hawthorn defended themselves
with their spikes the heather kept off the enemy on every side, and the
broom was well to the front, but the fern was plundered, and the furze
did not do well the stout, lofty pine, the intruding peartree, the
gloomy ash, the bashful chestnuttree, the prosperous beech, the
longenduring poplar, the scarce plumtree, the shelterseeking privet
and woodbine, the wild, foreign laburnum â€the bean, bearing in its
shade an army of phantomsâ€ rosebush, raspberry, ivy, cherrytree, and
medlarâ€”all took their parts.

In the ranks of ades there were eually strange fighters. We are told
of a hundredheaded beast, carrying a formidable battalion under the
root of its tongue and another in the back of its head there was a
gaping black toad with a hundred claws and a crested snake of many
colours, within whose flesh a hundred souls were tormented for their
sinsâ€”in fact, it would need a or or a ante to do ustice to this
weird battle between the arrayed magics of heaven and hell.

It was magic that decided its fate. here was a fighter in the ranks of
ades who could not be overcome unless his antagonist guessed his nameâ€”a
peculiarity of the terrene gods, remarks rofessor hys, which has
been preserved in our popular fairy tales. Gwydion guessed the name, and
sang these two versesâ€”

          â€urehoofed is my steed impelled by the spur
           he high sprigs of alder are on thy shield
           rn art thou called, of the glittering branches

          â€urehoofed is my steed in the day of battle
           he high sprigs of alder are on thy hand
           rn ... by the branch thou bearest
           as Amaethon the Good prevailedâ€2

hus the power of the dark gods was broken, and the sons of n retained
for the use of men the deer, the dog, and the lapwing, stolen from that
underworld, whence all good gifts came.

It was always to obtain some practical benefit that the gods of light
fought against the gods of darkness. he last and greatest of Gwydionâ€s
raids upon ades was undertaken to procureâ€”pork

Gwydion had heard that there had come to yfed some strange beasts, such
as had never been seen before. hey were called â€pigsâ€ or â€swineâ€, and
Arawn, ing of Annwn, had sent them as a gift to ryderi son of wyll.
hey were small animals, and their flesh was said to be better than the
flesh of oxen. e thought it would be a good thing to get them, either
by force or fraud, from the dark powers. Mth son of Mthonwy, who ruled
the children of n from his lympus of Caer athyl, gave his
consent, and Gwydion set off, with eleven others, to ryderiâ€s
palace. hey disguised themselves as bards, so as to be received by
ryderi, and Gwydion, who was â€the best teller of tales in the worldâ€,
entertained the rince of yfed and his court more than they had ever
been entertained by any storyteller before. hen he asked ryderi to
grant him a boonâ€”the animals which had come from Annwn. ut ryderi had
pledged his word to Arawn that he would neither sell nor give away any
of the new creatures until they had increased to double their number,
and he told the disguised Gwydion so.

â€ord,â€ said Gwydion, â€I can set you free from your promise. either
give me the swine at once, nor yet refuse them to me altogether, and
tomorrow I will show you how.â€

e went to the lodging ryderi had assigned him, and began to work his
charms and illusions. ut of fungus he made twelve gilded shields, and
twelve horses with gold harness, and twelve black greyhounds with white
breasts, each wearing a golden collar and leash. And these he showed to
ryderi.

â€ord,â€ said he, â€there is a release from the word you spoke last
evening concerning the swineâ€”that you may neither give them nor sell
them. You may exchange them for something which is better. I will give
you these twelve horses with their gold harness, and these twelve
greyhounds with their gold collars and leashes, and these twelve gilded
shields for them.â€

ryderi took counsel with his men, and agreed to the bargain. o Gwydion
and his followers took the swine and went away with them, hurrying as
fast as they could, for Gwydion knew that the illusion would not last
longer than a day. he memory of their ourney was long kept up every
place where they rested between yfed and Caer athyl is remembered by a
name connecting it with pigs. here is a Mochdrev â€wineâ€s ownâ€ in
each of the three counties of Cardiganshire, Montgomeryshire, and
enbighshire, and a Castell y Moch â€wineâ€s Castleâ€ near Mochnant
â€wineâ€s rookâ€, which runs through part of the two latter counties.
hey shut up the pigs in safety, and then assembled all Mthâ€s army for
the horses and hounds and shields had returned to fungus, and ryderi,
who guessed Gwydionâ€s part in it, was coming northward in hot haste.

here were two battlesâ€”one at Maenor enardd, near Conway, and the other
at Maenor Alun, now called Coed elen, near Caernarvon. eaten in both,
ryderi fell back upon ant Call, about nine miles from Caernarvon. ere
he was again defeated with great slaughter, and sent hostages, asking
for peace and a safe retreat.

his was granted by Mth but, none the less, the army of the sons of
n insisted on following the retreating host, and harassing it. o
ryderi sent a complaint to Mth, demanding that, if there must still be
war, Gwydion, who had caused all the trouble, should fight with him in
single combat.

Gwydion agreed, and the champions of light and darkness met face to
face. ut ryderi was the waning power, and he fell before the strength
and magic of Gwydion. â€And at Maen yriawc, above Melenryd, was he
buried, and there is his graveâ€, says the Mabinogi, though the ancient
Welsh poem, called the â€erses of the Graves of the Warriorsâ€,
assigns him a different restingplace.

his decisive victory over ades and its kings was the end of the
struggle, until it was renewed, with still more complete success, by one
greater than Gwydionâ€”the invincible Arthur.

he â€Coming of Arthurâ€, his sudden rise into prominence, is one of the
many problems of the Celtic mythology. e is not mentioned in any of the
our ranches of the Mabinogi, which deal with the races of ritish gods
euivalent to the Gaelic uatha  anann. he earliest references to
him in Welsh literature seem to treat him as merely a warriorchieftain,
no better, if no worse, than several others, such as â€Geraint, a
tributary prince of evonâ€, immortalized both by the bards and by
ennyson. hen, following upon this, we find him lifted to the
extraordinary position of a king of gods, to whom the old divine
families of n, of lyr, and of wyll pay unuestioned homage. riads
tell us that luddâ€”the eus of the older antheonâ€”was one of Arthurâ€s
â€hree Chief Warnightsâ€, and Arawn, ing of ades, one of his â€hree
Chief Counselling nightsâ€. In the story called the â€ream of honabwyâ€,
in the ed ook of ergest, he is shown as a leader to whom are subect
those we know to have been of divine raceâ€”sons of udd, of lyr, of
rn, of Govannan, and of Arianrod. In another â€ed ookâ€ tale, that of
â€ulhwch and lwenâ€, even greater gods are his vassals. Amaethon son of
n, ploughs for him, and Govannan son of n, rids the iron, while two
other sons of eli, ynniaw and eibaw, â€turned into oxen on account of
their sinsâ€, toil at the yoke, that a mountain may be cleared and tilled
and the harvest reaped in one day. e assembles his champions to seek
the â€treasures of ritainâ€ and Manawyddan son of lyr, Gwyn son of
udd, and ryderi son of wyll rally round him at his call.

he most probable, and only adeuate explanation, is given by rofessor
hys, who considers that the fames of two separate Arthurs have been
accidentally confused, to the exceeding renown of a composite,
halfreal, halfmythical personage into whom the two blended. ne
of these was a divine Arthur, a god more or less widely worshipped in
the Celtic worldâ€”the same, no doubt, whom an ex voto inscription found
in southeastern rance calls Mercurius Artaius.0 he other was a
human Arthur, who held among the ritons the post which, under oman
domination, had been called Comes ritanni. his â€Count of ritainâ€
was the supreme military authority he had a roving commission to defend
the country against foreign invasion and under his orders were two
slightly subordinate officers, the ux ritanniarum uke of the
ritains, who had charge of the northern wall, and the Comes ittoris
axonici Count of the axon hore, who guarded the southeastern
coasts. he ritons, after the departure of the omans, long kept intact
the organization their conuerors had built up and it seems reasonable
to believe that this post of leader in war was the same which early
Welsh literature describes as that of â€emperorâ€, a title given to Arthur
alone among the ritish heroes. he fame of Arthur the mperor
blended with that of Arthur the God, so that it became conterminous with
the area over which we have traced rythonic settlement in Great
ritain.2 ence the many disputes, ably, if unprofitably, conducted,
over â€Arthurian localitiesâ€ and the sites of such cities as Camelot, and
of Arthurâ€s twelve great battles. istorical elements doubtless coloured
the tales of Arthur and his companions, but they are none the less as
essentially mythic as those told of their Gaelic analoguesâ€”the ed
ranch eroes of lster and the enians.

f those two cycles, it is with the latter that the Arthurian legend
shows most affinity. Arthurâ€s position as supreme warleader of
ritain curiously parallels that of innâ€s as general of a â€native Irish
militiaâ€. is â€ound ableâ€ of warriors also reminds one of innâ€s
enians sworn to adventure. oth alike battle with human and superhuman
foes. oth alike harry urope, even to the walls of ome. he lovestory
of Arthur, his wife Gwynhwyvar Guinevere, and his nephew Medrawt
Mordred, resembles in several ways that of inn, his wife Grainne, and
his nephew iarmait. In the stories of the last battles of Arthur and of
the enians, the essence of the kindred myth still subsists, though the
actual exponents of it slightly differ. At the fight of Camlan, it was
Arthur and Medrawt themselves who fought the final duel. ut in the last
stand of the enians at Gabhra, the original protagonists have given
place to their descendants and representatives. oth inn and Cormac
were already dead. It is scar, innâ€s grandson, and Cairbr, Cormacâ€s
son, who fight and slay each other. And again, ust as Arthur was
thought by many not to have really died, but to have passed to â€the
island valley of Avilionâ€, so a cottish legend tells us how, ages after
the enians, a man, landing by chance upon a mysterious western island,
met and spoke with inn mac Coul. ven the alternative legend, which
makes Arthur and his warriors wait under the earth in a magic sleep for
the return of their triumph, is also told of the enians.

ut these parallels, though they illustrate Arthurâ€s preeminence, do
not show his real place among the gods. o determine this, we must
examine the ranks of the older dynasties carefully, to see if any are
missing whose attributes this newcomer may have inherited. We find
ludd and Gwyn, Arawn, ryderi, and Manawyddan side by side with him
under their own names. Among the children of n are Amaethon and
Govannan. ut here the list stops, with a notable omission. here is no
mention, in later myth, of Gwydion. hat greatest of the sons of n has
fallen out, and vanished without a sign.

ingularly enough, too, the same stories that were once told of Gwydion
are now attached to the name of Arthur. o that we may assume, with
rofessor hys, that Arthur, the prominent god of a new antheon, has
taken the place of Gwydion in the old. A comparison of
Gwydionmyths and Arthurmyths shows an almost exact correspondence in
everything but name.

ike Gwydion, Arthur is the exponent of culture and of arts. herefore
we see him carrying on the same war against the underworld for wealth
and wisdom that Gwydion and the sons of n waged against the sons of
lyr, the ea, and of wyll, the ead of ades.

ike Gwydion, too, Arthur suffered early reverses. e failed, indeed,
even where his prototype had succeeded. Gwydion, we know from the
Mabinogi of Mth, successfully stole ryderiâ€s pigs, but Arthur was
utterly baffled in his attempt to capture the swine of a similar prince
of the underworld, called March son of Meirchion. Also as with
Gwydion, his earliest reconnaissance of ades was disastrous, and led to
his capture and imprisonment. Manawyddan son of lyr, confined him in
the mysterious and gruesome bonefortress of eth and Anoeth, and there
he languished for three days and three nights before a rescuer came in
the person of Goreu, his cousin. ut, in the end, he triumphed. A
Welsh poem, ascribed to the bard aliesin, relates, under the title â€he
poiling of Annwnâ€, an expedition of Arthur and his followers into
the very heart of that country, from which he appears to have returned
for the verses are somewhat obscure with the loss of almost all his
men, but in possession of the obect of his uestâ€”the magic cauldron of
inspiration and poetry.

aliesin tells the story as an eyewitness. e may well have done so
for it was his boast that from the creation of the world he had allowed
himself to miss no event of importance. e was in eaven, he tells
us, when ucifer fell, and in the Court of n before Gwydion was
born he had been among the constellations both with Mary Magdalene and
with the pagan goddess Arianrod he carried a banner before Alexander,
and was chief director of the building of the ower of abel he saw the
fall of roy and the founding of ome he was with oah in the Ark, and
he witnessed the destruction of odom and Gomorrah and he was present
both at the Manger of ethlehem and at the Cross of Calvary. ut,
unfortunately, aliesin, as a credible personage, rests under exactly
the same disabilities as Arthur himself. It is not denied by scholars
that there was a real aliesin, a sixthcentury bard to whom were
attributed, and who may have actually composed, some of the poems in the
ook of aliesin. ut there was also another aliesin, whom, as a
mythical poet of the ritish Celts, rofessor hys is inclined to euate
with the Gaelic ssian.0 he traditions of the two mingled, endowing
the historic aliesin with the godlike attributes of his predecessor,
and clothing the mythical aliesin with some of the actuality of his
successor.

It is regrettable that our bard did not at times sing a little less
incoherently, for his poem contains the fullest description that has
come down to us of the other world as the ritons conceived it.
Apparently the numerous names, all different and some now
untranslatable, refer to the same place, and they must be collated to
form a right idea of what Annwn was like. With the exception of an
obviously spurious last verse, here omitted, the poem is magnificently
pagan, and uite a storehouse of ritish mythology2.

 â€I will praise the overeign, supreme ord of the land,
  Who hath extended his dominion over the shore of the world.
  tout was the prison of Gweir, in Caer idi,
  hrough the spite of wyll and ryderi
  o one before him went into it.
  he heavy blue chain firmly held the youth,
  And before the spoils of Annwn woefully he sang,
  And thenceforth till doom he shall remain a bard.
  hrice enough to fill rydwen we went into it
  xcept seven, none returned from Caer idi.

 â€Am I not a candidate for fame, to be heard in song
  In Caer edryvan, four times revolving
  he first word from the cauldron, when was it spoken
  y the breath of nine maidens it was gently warmed.
  Is it not the cauldron of the chief of Annwn What is its fashion
  A rim of pearls is round its edge.
  It will not cook the food of a coward or one forsworn.
  A sword flashing bright will be raised to him,
  And left in the hand of leminawg.
  And before the door of the gate of ffern the lamp was burning.
  When we went with Arthurâ€”a splendid labourâ€”
  xcept seven, none returned from Caer edwyd.

 â€Am I not a candidate for fame, to be heard in song
  In Caer edryvan, in the Isle of the trong oor,
  Where twilight and pitchy darkness meet together,
  And bright wine is the drink of the host
  hrice enough to fill rydwen we went on the sea.
  xcept seven, none returned from Caer igor.

 â€I will not allow much praise to the leaders of literature.
  eyond Caer Wydyr0 they saw not the prowess of Arthur
  hreescore hundreds stood on the walls
  It was hard to converse with their watchman.
  hrice enough to fill rydwen we went with Arthur
  xcept seven, none returned from Caer Golud.

 â€I will not allow much praise to the spiritless.
  hey know not on what day, or who caused it,
  r in what hour of the serene day Cwy was born,
  r who caused that he should not go to the dales of evwy.
  hey know not the brindled ox with the broad headband,
  Whose yoke is sevenscore handbreadths.
  When we went with Arthur, of mournful memory,
  xcept seven, none returned from Caer andwy2.

 â€I will not allow much praise to those of drooping courage.
  hey know not on what day the chief arose,
  or in what hour of the serene day the owner was born,
  or what animal they keep, with its head of silver.
  When we went with Arthur, of anxious striving,
  xcept seven, none returned from Caer chrenâ€.

Many of the allusions of this poem will perhaps never be explained. We
know no better than the â€leaders of literatureâ€ whom the vainglorious
aliesin taunted with their ignorance and lack of spirit in what hour
Cwy was born, or even who he was, much less who prevented him from going
to the dales of evwy, wherever they may have been. We are in the dark
as much as they were with regard to the significance of the brindled ox
with the broad headband, and of the other animal with the silver
head. ut the earlier portion of the poem is, fortunately, clearer,
and it gives glimpses of a grandeur of savage imagination. he
strongdoored, foursuare fortress of glass, manned by its dumb, ghostly
sentinels, spun round in neverceasing revolution, so that few could
find its entrance it was pitchdark save for the twilight made by the
lamp burning before its circling gate feasting went on there, and
revelry, and in its centre, choicest of its many riches, was the
pearlrimmed cauldron of poetry and inspiration, kept bubbling by the
breaths of nine ritish pythonesses, so that it might give forth its
oracles. o this scanty information we may add a few lines, also by
aliesin, and contained in a poem called â€A ong Concerning the ons of
lyr ab rochwel owysâ€â€”

            â€erfect is my chair in Caer idi
             lague and age hurt not him whoâ€s in itâ€”
             hey know, Manawyddan and ryderi.
             hree organs round a fire sing before it,
             And about its points are oceanâ€s streams
             And the abundant well above itâ€”
             weeter than white wine the drink in it.â€

ittle is, however, added by it to our knowledge. It reminds us that
Annwn was surrounded by the seaâ€”â€the heavy blue chainâ€ which held Gweir
so firmlyâ€”it informs us that the â€bright wineâ€ which was â€the drink of
the hostâ€ was kept in a well it adds to the revelry the singing of the
three organs it makes a point that its inhabitants were freed from age
and death and, last of all, it shows us, as we might have expected, the
ubiuitous aliesin as a privileged resident of this delightful region.
We have two clues as to where the country may have been situated. undy
Island, off the coast of evonshire, was anciently called Ynys Wair,
the â€Island of Gweirâ€, or Gwydion. he Welsh translation of the eint
Greal, an Angloorman romance embodying much of the old mythology,
locates its â€urning Castleâ€â€”evidently the same as Caer idiâ€”in the
district around and comprising uffin Island off the coast of
Anglesey. ut these are slender threads by which to tether to firm
ground a realm of the imagination.

With Gwydion, too, have disappeared the whole of the characters
connected with him in that portion of the Mabinogi of Mth, on of
Mathonwy, which recounts the myth of the birth of the sungod. either
Mth himself, nor leu law Gyffes, nor ylan, nor their mother,
Arianrod, play any more part they have vanished as completely as
Gwydion. ut the essence of the myth of which they were the figures
remains intact. Gwydion was the father by his sister Arianrod, wife of a
waning heavengod called wyvre pace, of twin sons, leu, a god of
light, and ylan, a god of darkness and we find this same story woven
into the very innermost texture of the legend of Arthur. he new
Arianrod, though called â€Morgawseâ€ by ir homas Malory, and â€Annaâ€
by Geoffrey of Monmouth, is known to earlier Welsh myth as
â€Gwyarâ€0. he was the sister of Arthur and the wife of the skygod,
ludd, and her name, which means â€shed bloodâ€ or â€goreâ€, reminds us of
the relationship of the Morrg, the wargoddess of the Gaels, to the
heavengod uada. he new leu law Gyffes is called Gwalchmei,
that is, the â€alcon of Mayâ€2, and the new ylan is Medrawt, at once
Arthurâ€s son and Gwalchmeiâ€s brother, and the bitterest enemy of
both.

esides these â€old friends with new facesâ€, Arthur brings with him into
prominence a fresh antheon, most of whom also replace the older gods of
the heavens and earth and the regions under the earth. he eus of
Arthurâ€s cycle is called Myrddin, who passed into the ormanrench
romances as â€Merlinâ€. All the myths told of him bear witness to his high
estate. he first name of ritain, before it was inhabited, was, we
learn from a triad, Clas Myrddin, that is, â€Myrddinâ€s nclosureâ€.
e is given a wife whose attributes recall those of the consorts of
uada and ludd. he is described as the only daughter of Coelâ€”the
ritish name of the Gaulish Camulus, a god of war and the skyâ€”and was
called len wyddawg, that is, â€len, eader of ostsâ€. er memory is
still preserved in Wales in connection with ancient roadways such names
as fordd len â€lenâ€s oadâ€ and arn len â€lenâ€s Causewayâ€
seem to show that the paths on which armies marched were ascribed or
dedicated to her. As Myrddinâ€s wife, she is credited with having
founded the town of Carmarthen Caer Myrddin, as well as the â€highest
fortress in Arvonâ€, which must have been the site near eddgelert still
called inas mrys, the â€own of mrysâ€, one of Myrddinâ€s epithets or
names.

rofessor hys is inclined to credit Myrddin, or, rather, the ritish
eus under whatever name, with having been the god especially worshipped
at tonehenge. Certainly this impressive temple, ever unroofed and
open to the sun and wind and rain of heaven, would seem peculiarly
appropriate to a ritish supreme god of light and sky. either are we
uite without documentary evidence which will allow us to connect it
with him. Geoffrey of Monmouth, whose historical fictions usually
conceal mythological facts, relates that the stones which compose it
were erected by Merlin. efore that, they had stood in Ireland, upon a
hill which Geoffrey calls â€Mount illarausâ€, and which can be identified
as the same spot known to Irish legend as the â€ill of isnechâ€, and,
still earlier, connected with alor. According to ritish tradition, the
primeval giants who first colonized Ireland had brought them from their
original home on â€the farthest coast of Africaâ€, on account of their
miraculous virtues for any water in which they were bathed became a
sovereign remedy either for sickness or for wounds. y the order of
Aurelius, a halfreal, halfmythical king of ritain, Merlin brought
them thence to ngland, to be set up on alisbury lain as a monument to
the ritish chieftains treacherously slain by engist and his axons.
With this scrap of native information about tonehenge we may compare
the only other piece we haveâ€”the account of the classic iodorus, who
called it a temple of Apollo. At first, these two statements seem
to conflict. ut it is far from unlikely that the earlier Celtic
settlers in ritain made little or no religious distinction between sky
and sun. he sungod, as a separate personage, seems to have been the
conception of a comparatively late age. Celtic mythology allows us to be
present, as it were, at the births both of the Gaelic ugh amhfada and
the ritish leu law Gyffes.

ven the wellknown story of Myrddinâ€s, or Merlinâ€s final imprisonment
in a tomb of airy enchantmentâ€”â€a tour withouten walles, or withoute eny
closureâ€â€”reads marvellously like a myth of the sun â€with all his fires
and travelling glories round himâ€.00 ncircled, shielded, and made
splendid by his atmosphere of living light, the ord of eaven moves
slowly towards the west, to disappear at last into the sea as one local
version of the myth puts it, or on to a faroff island as another
says, or into a dark forest the choice of a third.0 When the myth
became finally fixed, it was ardsey Island, off the extreme westernmost
point of Caernarvonshire, that was selected as his last abode. Into it
he went with nine attendant bards, taking with him the â€hirteen
reasures of ritainâ€, thenceforth lost to men. ardsey Island no doubt
derives its name from this story and what is probably an allusion to it
is found in a firstcentury Greek writer called lutarch, who describes
a grammarian called emetrius as having visited ritain, and brought
home an account of his travels. e mentioned several uninhabited and
sacred islands off our coasts which he said were named after gods and
heroes, but there was one especially in which Cronos was imprisoned with
his attendant deities, and riareus keeping watch over him as he slept
â€for sleep was the bond forged for himâ€.02 oubtless this
disinherited deity, whom the Greek, after his fashion, called â€Cronosâ€,
was the ritish heaven and sungod, after he had descended into the
prison of the west.

Among other newcomers is ai, who, as ir ay the eneschal, fills so
large a part in the later romances. urged of his worst offences, and
reduced to a surly butler to Arthur, he is but a shadow of the earlier
ai who murdered Arthurâ€s son lacheu0, and can only be acuitted,
through the obscurity of the poem that relates the incident, of having
also carried off, or having tried to carry off, Arthurâ€s wife,
Gwynhwyvar.0 e is thought to have been a personification of
fire,0 upon the strength of a description given of him in the
mythical romance of â€ulhwch and lwenâ€. â€ery subtleâ€, it says, â€was
ai. When it pleased him he could render himself as tall as the highest
tree in the forest. And he had another peculiarityâ€”so great was the heat
of his nature, that, when it rained hardest, whatever he carried
remained dry for a handbreadth above and a handbreadth below his hand
and when his companions were coldest, it was to them as fuel with which
to light their fire.â€

Another personage who owes his prominence in the Arthurian story to his
importance in Celtic myth was March son of Meirchion, whose swine Arthur
attempted to steal, as Gwydion had done those of ryderi. In the
romances, he has become the cowardly and treacherous Mark, king,
according to some stories, of Cornwall, but according to others, of the
whole of ritain, and known to all as the husband of the air Isoult,
and the uncle of ir ristrem. ut as a deformed deity of the
underworld0 he can be found in Gaelic as well as in ritish myth. e
cannot be considered as originally different from Morc, a king of the
omors at the time when from their Glass Castle they so fatally
oppressed the Children of emed.0 he omors were distinguished by
their animal features, and March had the same peculiarity.0 When ir
homas Malory relates how, to please Arthur and ir auncelot, ir
inadan made a song about Mark, â€which was the worst lay that ever
harper sang with harp or any other instruments,â€0 he does not tell
us wherein the sting of the lampoon lay. It no doubt reminded ing Mark
of the unpleasant fact that he hadâ€”not like his hrygian counterpart,
assâ€s butâ€”horseâ€s ears. e was, in fact, a Celtic Midas, a distinction
which he shared with one of the mythical kings of early Ireland.0

either can we pass over rien, a deity of the underworld akin to, or
perhaps the same as, rn. ike that son of lyr, he was at once a
god of battle and of minstrelsy2 he was adored by the bards as
their patron his badge was the raven bran, in Welsh
while, to make his identification complete, there is an extant poem
which tells how rien, wounded, ordered his own head to be cut off by
his attendants. is wife was Modron, known as the mother of
Mabon, the sungod to whom inscriptions exist as Maponos. Another of
the children of rien and Modron is wain, which was perhaps only
another name for Mabon. aliesin calls him â€chief of the glittering
westâ€, and he is as certainly a sungod as his father rien, â€lord
of the eveningâ€, was a ruler of the dark underworld.

It is by reason of the preeminence of Arthur that we find gathered
round him so many gods, all probably various tribal personifications of
the same few mythological ideas. he Celts, both of the Gaelic and the
ritish branches, were split up into numerous petty tribes, each with
its own local deities embodying the same essential conceptions under
different names. here was the god of the underworld, gigantic in
figure, patron alike of warrior and minstrel, teacher of the arts of
elouence and literature, and owner of boundless wealth, whom some of
the ritish tribes worshipped as rn, others as rien, others as wyll,
or March, or Mth, or Arawn, or gyrvran. here was the lord of an
elysiumâ€”ades in its aspect of a paradise of the departed rather than of
the primeval subterranean realm where all thingâ€s originatedâ€”whom the
ritons of Wales called Gwyn, or Gwynwas the ritons of Cornwall,
Melwas and the ritons of omerset, Avallon, or Avallach. nder this
last title, his realm is called Ynys Avallon, â€Avallonâ€s Islandâ€, or,
as we know the word, Avilion. It was said to be in the â€and of ummerâ€,
which, in the earliest myth, signified ades and it was only in later
days that the mystic Isle of Avilion became fixed to earth as
Glastonbury, and the lysian â€and of ummerâ€ as omerset.20 here
was a mighty ruler of heaven, a â€god of battlesâ€, worshipped on high
places, in whose hands was â€the stern arbitrament of warâ€ some knew him
as ludd, others as Myrddin, or as mrys. here was a gentler deity,
friendly to man, to help whom he fought or caoled the powers of the
underworld Gwydion he was called, and Arthur. ast, perhaps, to be
imagined in concrete shape, there was a longarmed, sharpspeared
sungod who aided the culturegod in his work, and was known as leu, or
Gwalchmei, or Mabon, or wain, or eredur, and no doubt by many another
name and with him is usually found a brother representing not light,
but darkness. his expression of a single idea by different names may be
also observed in Gaelic myth, though not uite so clearly. In the
hurtling of clan against clan, many such divinities perished altogether
out of memory, or survived only as names, to make up, in Ireland, the
vast, shadowy population claiming to be uatha  anann, and, in
ritain, the long list of Arthurâ€s followers. thersâ€”gods of stronger
communitiesâ€”would increase their fame as their worshippers increased
their territory, until, as happened in Greece, the chief deities of many
tribes came together to form a national antheon.

We have already tried to explain the â€Coming of Arthurâ€ historically.
Mythologically, he came, as, according to Celtic ideas, all things came
originally, from the underworld. is father is called ther
endragon.2 ut ther endragon is for the word â€dragonâ€ is not
part of the name, but a title signifying â€warleaderâ€ ther en, that
is, rn, under his name of the â€Wonderful eadâ€,22 so that, in spite
of the legend which describes Arthur as having disinterred rnâ€s head
on ower ill, where it watched against invasion, because he thought it
beneath his dignity to keep ritain in any other way than by
valour,2 we must recognize the ing of ades as his father. his
being so, it would only be natural that he should take a wife from the
same eternal country, and we need not be surprised to find in
Gwynhwyvarâ€s father, gyrvran, a personage corresponding in all respects
to the Celtic conception of the ruler of the underworld. e was of
gigantic size2 he was the owner of a cauldron out of which three
Muses had been born2 and he was the patron of the bards,2 who
deemed him to have been the originator of their art. More than this, his
very name, analysed into its original ocur vran, means the evil
bran, or raven, the bird of death.2

ut Welsh tradition credits Arthur with three wives, each of them called
Gwynhwyvar. his peculiar arrangement is probably due to the Celtic love
of triads and one may compare them with the three tains who pass
through the mythicoheroic story of ochaid Airem, tain, and Mider. f
these three Gwynhwyvars,2 besides the Gwynhwyvar, daughter of
gyrvran, one was the daughter of Gwyrd Gwent, of whom we know nothing
but the name, and the other of Gwyrthur ap Greidawl, the same â€ictor
son of corcherâ€ with whom Gwyn son of udd, fought, in earlier myth,
perpetual battle for the possession of Creudylad, daughter of the
skygod ludd. his same eternal strife between the powers of light and
darkness for the possession of a symbolical damsel is waged again in the
Arthurian cycle but it is no longer for Creudylad that Gwyn contends,
but for Gwynhwyvar, and no longer with Gwyrthur, but with Arthur. It
would seem to have been a Cornish form of the myth for the dark god is
called â€Melwasâ€, and not â€Gwynwasâ€, or â€Gwynâ€, his name in Welsh.2
Melwas lay in ambush for a whole year, and finally succeeded in carrying
off Gwynhwyvar to his palace in Avilion. ut Arthur pursued, and
besieged that stronghold, ust as ochaid Airem had, in the Gaelic
version of the universal story, mined and sapped at Miderâ€s sdh of
ri eith.0 Mythology, as well as history, repeats itself and
Melwas was obliged to restore Gwynhwyvar to her rightful lord.

It is not Melwas, however, that in the bestknown versions of the story
contends with Arthur for the love of Gwynhwyvar. he most widespread
early tradition makes Arthurâ€s rival his nephew Medrawt. ere rofessor
hys traces a striking parallel between the ritish legend of Arthur,
Gwynhwyvar, and Medrawt, and the Gaelic story of Airem, tain, and
Mider. he two myths are practically counterparts for the names of
all the three pairs agree in their essential meaning. â€Airemâ€, like
â€Arthurâ€, signifies the â€loughmanâ€, the divine institutor of
agriculture â€tainâ€, the â€hining neâ€, is a fit parallel to
â€Gwynhwyvarâ€, the â€White Apparitionâ€ while â€Miderâ€ and â€Medrawtâ€ both
come from the same root, a word meaning â€to hitâ€, either literally, or
else metaphorically, with the mind, in the sense of coming to a
decision. o attempt to explain this myth is to raise the vexed uestion
of the meaning of mythology. Is it day and dark that strive for dawn, or
summer and winter for the lovely spring, or does it shadow forth the
rescue of the grain that makes manâ€s life from the devouring underworld
by the farmerâ€s wit When this can be finally resolved, a multitude of
Celtic myths will be explained. verywhere arise the same combatants for
the stolen bride one has the attributes of light, the other is a
champion of darkness.

ven in ir homas Maloryâ€s version of the Arthurian story, taken by him
from rench romances far removed from the original tradition, we find
the myth subsisting. Medrawtâ€s original place as the lover of Arthurâ€s
ueen had been taken in the romances by ir auncelot, who, if he was
not some now undiscoverable Celtic god,2 must have been an invention
of the orman adapters. ut the story which makes Medrawt Arthurâ€s rival
has been preserved in the account of how ir Mordred would have wedded
Guinevere by force, as part of the rebellion which he made against his
king and uncle. his strife was Celtic myth long before it became
part of the pseudohistory of early ritain. he triads tell us how
Arthur and Medrawt raided each otherâ€s courts during the ownerâ€s
absence. Medrawt went to elli Wic, in Cornwall, ate and drank
everything he could find there, and insulted ueen Gwynhwyvar, in
revenge for which Arthur went to Medrawtâ€s court and killed man and
beast. heir struggle only ended with the attle of Camlan and that
mythical combat, which chroniclers have striven to make historical, is
full of legendary detail. radition tells how Arthur and his antagonist
shared their forces three times during the fight, which caused it to be
known as one of the â€hree rivolous attles of ritainâ€, the idea of
doing so being one of â€ritainâ€s hree Criminal esolutionsâ€. our alone
survived the fray one, because he was so ugly that all shrank from him,
believing him to be a devil another, whom no one touched because he was
so beautiful that they took him for an angel a third, whose great
strength no one could resist and Arthur himself, who, after revenging
the death of Gwalchmei upon Medrawt, went to the island of Avilion to
heal him of his grievous wounds.

And thenceâ€”from the lysium of the Celtsâ€”popular belief has always been
that he will some day return. ut ust as the gods of the Gaels are said
to dwell sometimes in the â€and of the ivingâ€, beyond the western wave,
and sometimes in the palace of a hollow hill, so Arthur is sometimes
thought to be in Avilion, and sometimes to be sitting with his champions
in a charmed sleep in some secret place, waiting for the trumpet to be
blown that shall call him forth to reconuer ritain. he legend is
found in the ildon ills in the nowdon district at Cadbury, in
omerset, the best authenticated Camelot in the ale of eath, in outh
Wales as well as in other places. e slumbers, but he has not died. he
ancient Welsh poem called â€he erses of the Graves of the
Warriorsâ€ enumerates the last restingplaces of most of the ritish
gods and demigods. â€he grave of Gwydion is in the marsh of inlleuâ€,
the grave of ieu law Gyffes is â€under the protection of the sea with
which he was familiarâ€, and â€where the wave makes a sullen sound is the
grave of ylanâ€ we know the graves of ryderi, of Gwalchmei, of March,
of Mabon, even of the great eli, but

            â€ot wise the thoughtâ€”a grave for Arthurâ€.

                         A  IAI


It is in keeping with the mythological character of Arthur that the
early Welsh tales recorded of him are of a different nature from those
which swell the pseudohistories of ennius and of Geoffrey of
Monmouth. We hear nothing of that subugation of the countries of
Western urope which fills so large a part in the two books of the
istoria ritonum which Geoffrey has devoted to him. Conueror he
is, but his conuests are not in any land known to geographers. It is
against ades, and not against ome, that he achieves his highest
triumphs. his is the true history of ing Arthur, and we may read more
fragments and snatches of it in two prosetales preserved in the ed
ook of ergest. oth these tales date, in the actual form in which they
have come down to us, from the twelfth century. ut, in each of them,
the writer seems to be stretching out his hands to gather in the dying
traditions of a very remote past.

When a Welsh manatarms named honabwy lay down, one night, to sleep
upon a yellow calfskin, the only furniture in a noisome hut, in which
he had taken shelter, that was comparatively free from vermin, he had
the vision which is related in the tale called â€he ream of
honabwyâ€. e thought that he was travelling with his companions
towards the evern, when they heard a rushing noise behind them, and,
looking back, saw a gigantic rider upon a monstrous horse. o terrible
was the horsemanâ€s appearance that they all started to run from him. ut
their running was of no avail, for every time the horse drew in its
breath, it sucked them back to its very chest, only, however, to fling
them forward as it breathed out again. In despair they fell down and
besought their pursuerâ€s mercy. e granted it, asked their names, and
told them, in return, his own. e was known as Iddawc the Agitator of
ritain for it was he who, in his love of war, had purposely
precipitated the attle of Camlan. Arthur had sent him to reason with
Medrawt but though Arthur had charged him with the fairest sayings he
could think of, Iddawc translated them into the harshest he could
devise. ut he had done seven yearsâ€ penance, and had been forgiven, and
was now riding to Arthurâ€s camp. hither he insisted upon taking
honabwy and his companions.

Arthurâ€s army was encamped for a mile around the ford of hyd y Groes,
upon both sides of the road and on a small flat island in the middle of
the river was the mperor himself, in converse with edwini the ishop
and Gwarthegyd, the son of aw. ike ssian, when he came back to
Ireland after his three hundred yearsâ€ soourn in the â€and of
romiseâ€,0 Arthur marvelled at the puny size of the people whom
Iddawc had brought for him to look at. â€And where, Iddawc, didst thou
find these little menâ€ â€I found them, ord, up yonder on the road.â€
hen the mperor smiled. â€ord,â€ said Iddawc, â€wherefore dost thou
laughâ€ â€Iddawc,â€ replied Arthur, â€I laugh not but it pitieth me that
men of such stature as these should have this island in their keeping,
after the men that guarded it of yore.â€ hen he turned away, and Iddawc
told honabwy and his companions to keep silent, and they would see what
they would see.

he scope of such a book as this allows no space to describe the persons
and euipments of the warriors who came riding down with their companies
to oin Arthur, as he made his great march to fight the attle of adon,
thought by some to be historical, and located at ath. he reader who
turns to the tale itself will see what honabwy saw. Many of Arthurâ€s
warriors he will know by name Caradawc the trongarmed, who is here
called a son, not of rn, but of lyr March son of Meirchion, the
underworld king ai, described as â€the fairest horseman in all Arthurâ€s
courtâ€ Gwalchmei, the son of Gwyar and of Arthur himself Mabon, the
son of Modron rystan son of allwch, the lover of â€he air Isoultâ€
Goreu, Arthurâ€s cousin and his rescuer from Manawyddanâ€s boneprison
these, and many more, will pass before him, as they passed before
honabwy during the three days and three nights that he slept and
dreamed upon the calfskin.

his story of the â€ream of honabwyâ€, elaborate as it is in all its
details, is yet, in substance, little more than a catalogue. he
intention of its unknown author seems to have been to draw a series of
pictures of what he considered to be the principal among Arthurâ€s
followers. he other storyâ€”that of â€ulhwch and lwenâ€â€”also takes this
catalogue form, but the matters enumerated are of a different kind. It
is not so much a record of men as of things. ot the heroes of ritain,
but the treasures of ritain are its subect. ne might compare it with
the Gaelic story of the adventures of the three sons of uirenn.

he â€hirteen reasures of ritainâ€ were famous in early legend. hey
belonged to gods and heroes, and were current in our island till the end
of the divine age, when Merlin, fading out of the world, took them with
him into his airy tomb, never to be seen by mortal eyes again. According
to tradition,2 they consisted of a sword, a basket, a drinkinghorn,
a chariot, a halter, a knife, a cauldron, a whetstone, a garment, a pan,
a platter, a chessboard, and a mantle, all possessed of not less
marvellous ualities than the apples, the pigskin, the spear, the
horses and chariot, the pigs, the houndwhelp, and the cookingspit
which the sons of uirenn obtained for ugh. It is these same
legendary treasures that reappear, no doubt, in the story of â€ulhwch
and lwenâ€. he number tallies, for there are thirteen of them. ome are
certainly, and others probably, identical with those of the other
tradition. hat there should be discrepancies need cause no surprise,
for it is not unlikely that there were several different versions of
their legend. veryone had heard of the hirteen reasures of ritain.
Many, no doubt, disputed as to what they were. thers might ask whence
they came. he story of â€ulhwch and lwenâ€ was composed to tell them.
hey were won by Arthur and his mighty men.

ulhwch is the hero of the story and lwen is its heroine, but
only, as it were, by courtesy. he pair provide a loveinterest which,
as in the tales of all primitive people, is kept in the background. he
woman, in such romances, takes the place of the gold and gems in a
modern â€treasurehuntâ€ story she is won by overcoming external
obstacles, and not by any difficulty in obtaining her own consent. In
this romance, ulhwch was the son of a king who afterwards married
a widow with a grownup daughter, whom his stepmother urged ulhwch to
marry. n his modestly replying that he was not yet of an age to wed,
she laid the destiny on him that he should never have a wife at all,
unless he could win lwen, the daughter of a terrible father called
â€awthorn, Chief of Giantsâ€.

he â€Chief of Giantsâ€ was as hostile to suitors as he was monstrous in
shape and no wonder for he knew that on his daughterâ€s marriage his
own life would come to an end. oth in this peculiarity and in the
description of his ponderous eyebrows, which fell so heavily over his
eyes that he could not see until they had been lifted up with forks, he
reminds one of the omor, alor. f his daughter, on the other hand, the
Welsh tale gives a description as beautiful as lwen was, herself. â€More
yellow was her head than the flower of the broom, and her skin was
whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands and her
fingers than the blossoms of the wood anemone amidst the spray of the
meadowfountain. he eye of the trained hawk, the glance of the
threemewed falcon was not brighter than hers. er bosom was more snowy
than the breast of the white swan, her cheek was redder than the reddest
roses. Whoso beheld her was filled with her love. our white trefoils
sprung up wherever she trod. And therefore was she called lwen.â€

ulhwch had no need to see her to fall in love with her. e blushed at
her very name, and asked his father how he could obtain her in marriage.
is father reminded him that he was Arthurâ€s cousin, and advised him to
claim lwen from him as a boon.

o ulhwch â€pricked forth upon a steed with head dappled grey, of four
winters old, firm of limb, with shellformed hoofs, having a bridle of
linked gold on his head, and upon him a saddle of costly gold. And in
the youthâ€s hand were two spears of silver, sharp, welltempered, headed
with steel, three ells in length, of an edge to wound the wind, and
cause blood to flow, and swifter than the fall of the dewdrop from the
blade of reedgrass upon the earth when the dew of une is at the
heaviest. A goldhilted sword was upon his thigh, the blade of which was
of gold, bearing a cross of inlaid gold of the hue of the lightning of
heaven his warhorn was of ivory. efore him were two brindled
whitebreasted greyhounds, having strong collars of rubies about their
necks, reaching from the shoulder to the ear. And the one that was on
the left side bounded across to the right side, and the one on the right
to the left, and like two seaswallows sported around him. And his
courser cast up four sods with his four hoofs, like four swallows in the
air, about his head, now above, now below. About him was a fourcornered
cloth of purple, and an apple of gold was at each corner, and every one
of the apples was of the value of an hundred kine. And there was
precious gold of the value of three hundred kine upon his shoes, and
upon his stirrups, from his knee to the tip of his toe. And the blade of
grass bent not beneath him, so light was his courserâ€s tread as he
ourneyed towards the gate of Arthurâ€s palace.â€

or did this bold suitor stand greatly upon ceremony. e arrived after
the portal of the palace had been closed for the night, and, contrary to
all precedent, sent to Arthur demanding instant entry. Although, too, it
was the custom for visitors to dismount at the horseblock at the gate,
he did not do so, but rode his charger into the hall. After greetings
had passed between him and Arthur, and he had announced his name, he
demanded lwen for his bride at the hands of the mperor and his
warriors.

either Arthur nor any of his court had ever heard of lwen. owever, he
promised his cousin either to find her for him, or to prove that there
was no such person. e ordered his most skilful warriors to accompany
ulhwch ai, with his companion edwyr, the swiftest of men ynddelig,
who was as good a guide in a strange country as in his own Gwrhyr, who
knew all the languages of men, as well as of all other creatures
Gwalchmei, who never left an adventure unachieved and Menw, who could
render himself and his companions invisible at will.

hey travelled until they came to a castle on an open plain. eeding on
the plain was a countless herd of sheep, and, on a mound close by, a
monstrous shepherd with a monstrous dog. Menw cast a spell over the dog,
and they approached the shepherd. e was called Custennin, a brother of
awthorn, while his wife was a sister of ulhwchâ€s own mother. he evil
chief of giants had reduced his brother to servitude, and murdered all
his twentyfour sons save one, who was kept hidden in a stone chest.
herefore he welcomed ulhwch and the embassy from Arthur, and promised
to help them secretly, the more readily since ai offered to take the
one surviving son under his protection. Custenninâ€s wife procured
ulhwch a secret meeting with lwen, and the damsel did not altogether
discourage her wooerâ€s suit.

he party started for awthornâ€s castle. Without raising any alarm, they
slew the nine porters and the nine watchdogs, and came unhindered into
the hall. hey greeted the ponderous giant, and announced the reason of
their coming. â€Where are my pages and my servantsâ€ he said. â€aise up
the forks beneath my two eyebrows which have fallen over my eyes, so
that I may see the fashion of my soninlaw.â€ e glared at them, and
told them to come again upon the next day.

hey turned to go, and, as they did so, awthorn seized a poisoned dart,
and threw it after them. ut edwyr caught it, and cast it back,
wounding the giantâ€s knee. hey left him grumbling, slept at the house
of Custennin, and returned, the next morning.

Again they demanded lwen from her father, threatening him with death if
he refused. â€er four greatgrandmothers, and her four greatgrandsires
are yet alive,â€ replied awthorn â€it is needful that I take counsel of
them.â€ o they turned away, and, as they went, he flung a second dart,
which Menw caught, and hurled back, piercing the giantâ€s body.

he next time they came, awthorn warned them not to shoot at him again,
unless they desired death. hen he ordered his eyebrows to be lifted up,
and, as soon as he could see, he flung a poisoned dart straight at
ulhwch. ut the suitor himself caught it, and flung it back, so that it
pierced awthornâ€s eyeball and came out through the back of his head.
ere again we are reminded of the myth of ugh and alor. awthorn,
however, was not killed, though he was very much discomforted. â€A cursed
ungentle soninlaw, trulyâ€ he complained. â€As long as I remain alive,
my eyesight will be the worse. Whenever I go against the wind, my eyes
will water and peradventure my head will burn, and I shall have a
giddiness every new moon. Cursed be the fire in which it was forged
ike the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron.â€

It was now the turn of ulhwch and his party to warn the giant that
there must be no more dartthrowing. e appeared, indeed, more amenable
to reason, and allowed himself to be placed opposite to ulhwch, in a
chair, to discuss the amount of his daughterâ€s brideprice.

Its terms, as he gradually unfolded them, were terrific. he bloodfine
paid for Cian to ugh seems, indeed, a trifle beside it. o obtain
grain, for food and liuor at his daughterâ€s wedding, a vast hill which
he showed to ulhwch must be rooted up, levelled, ploughed, sown, and
harvested in one day. o one could do this except Amaethon son of n,
the divine husbandman, and Govannan son of n, the divine smith, and
they must have the service of three pairs of magic oxen. e must also
have returned to him the same nine bushels of flax which he had sown in
his youth, and which had never come up for only out of this very flax
should be made the white wimple for lwenâ€s head. or mead, too, he must
have honey â€nine times sweeter than the honey of the virgin swarmâ€.

hen followed the enumeration of the thirteen treasures to be paid to
him as dowry. uch a list of wedding presents was surely never known o
pot could hold such honey as he demanded but the magic vessel of lwyr,
the son of lwyryon. here would not be enough food for all the
weddingguests, unless he had the basket of Gwyddneu Garanhir, from
which all the men in the world could be fed, thrice nine at a time. o
cauldron could cook the meat, except that of iwrnach the Gael. he
mystic drinkinghorn of Gwlgawd Gododin must be there, to give them
drink. he harp of eirtu, which, like the agdaâ€s, played of itself,
must make music for them. he giant fatherinlawâ€s hair could only be
shorn with one instrumentâ€”the tusk of Whitetooth, ing of the oars,
and not even by that unless it was plucked alive out of its ownerâ€s
mouth. Also, before the hair could be cut, it must be spread out, and
this could not be done until it had been first softened with the blood
of the perfectly black sorceress, daughter of the perfectly white
sorceress, from the ource of the tream of orrow, on the borders of
hell. or could the sorceressâ€s blood be kept warm enough unless it was
placed in the bottles of Gwyddolwyn Gorr, which preserved the heat of
any liuor put into them, though it was carried from the east of the
world to the west. Another set of bottles he must also have to keep milk
for his guests inâ€”those bottles of hinnon hin arnawd in which no
drink ever turned sour. or himself, he reuired the sword of Gwrnach
the Giant, which that personage would never allow out of his own
keeping, because it was destined that he himself should fall by it. ast
of all, he must be given the comb, the razor, and the scissors which lay
between the ears of wrch rwyth, a king changed into the most terrible
of wild boars.

It is the chase of this boar which gives the story of â€ulhwch and
lwenâ€ its alternative titleâ€”â€he wrch rwythâ€. he task was one worthy
of gods and demigods. Its contemplation might well have appalled
ulhwch, who, however, was not so easily frightened. o every fresh
demand, every new obstacle put in his way, he gave the same answer

â€It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think that
it will not be easyâ€.

Whether it was easy or not will be seen from the conditions under which
alone the hunt could be brought to a successful end. o ordinary hounds
or huntsmen would avail. he chief of the pack must be rudwyn, the
whelp of Greid the son of ri, led in the one leash that would hold him,
fastened, by the one chain strong enough, to the one collar that would
contain his neck. o huntsman could hunt with this dog except Mabon son
of Modron and he had, ages before, been taken from between his mother
and the wall when he was three nights old, and it was not known where he
was, or even whether he were living or dead. here was only one steed
that could carry Mabon, namely Gwynn Mygdwn, the horse of Gweddw. wo
other marvellous hounds, the cubs of Gast hymhi, must also be obtained
they must be held in the only leash they would not break, for it would
be made out of the beard of the giant issull, plucked from him while he
was still alive. ven with this, no huntsman could lead them except
ynedyr Wyllt, who was himself nine times more wild than the wildest
beast upon the mountains. All Arthurâ€s mighty men must come to help,
even Gwyn son of udd, upon his black horse and how could he be spared
from his terrible duty of restraining the devils in hell from breaking
loose and destroying the world

ere is material for romance indeed ut, unhappily, we shall never know
the full story of how all these magic treasures were obtained, all these
magic hounds captured and compelled to hunt, all these magic huntsmen
brought to help. he storyâ€”which Mr. utt considers to be, â€saving
the finest tales of the â€Arabian ightsâ€, the greatest romantic fairy
tale the world has ever knownâ€â€”is not, as we have it now, complete. It
reads fully enough but, on casting backwards and forwards, between the
list of feats to be performed and the body of the tale which is supposed
to relate them all, we find many of them wanting. â€he host of Arthurâ€,
we are told, â€dispersed themselves into parties of one and twoâ€, each
party intent upon some separate uest. he adventures of some of them
have come down, but those of others have not. We are told how ai slew
Gwrnach the Giant with his own sword how Gwyrthur son of Greidawl,
Gwynâ€s rival for the love of Creudylad, saved an anthill from fire, and
how the grateful ants searched for and found the very flaxseeds sown by
awthorn in his youth how Arthurâ€s host surrounded and took Gast
hymhiâ€s cubs, and how ai and edwyr overcame issull, and plucked out
his beard with wooden tweezers, to make a leash for them. We learn how
Arthur went to Ireland, and brought back the cauldron of iwrnach the
Gael, full of Irish money how Whitetusk the oarking was chased and
killed and how Arthur condescended to slay the perfectly black
sorceress with his own hand. hat others of the treasures were acuired
is hinted rather than said. Most important of all for so much depended
on him, we find out where the stolen Mabon was, and learn how he was
rescued.

o many ages had elapsed since Mabon had disappeared that there seemed
little hope of ever finding news of him. evertheless Gwrhyr, who spoke
the languages of all creatures, went to enuire of that ancient bird,
the usel of Cilgwri. ut the usel, though in her time she had pecked a
smithâ€s anvil down to the size of a nut, was yet too young to have heard
of Mabon. he sent Gwrhyr to a creature formed before her, the tag of
edynvre. ut though the tag had lived to see an oaksapling slowly
grow to be a tree with a thousand branches, and as slowly decay again
till it was a withered stump, he had never heard of Mabon.

herefore he sent him on to a creature still older than himselfâ€”the wl
of Cwm Cawlwyd. he wood she lived in had been thrice rooted up, and had
thrice resown itself, and yet, in all that immense time, she had never
heard of Mabon. here was but one who might have, she told Gwrhyr, and
he was the agle of Gwern Abwy.

ere, at last, they struck Mabonâ€s trail. â€he agle said â€I have been
here for a great space of time, and when I first came hither there was a
rock here, from the top of which I pecked at the stars every evening
and now it is not so much as a span high. rom that day to this I have
been here, and I have never heard of the man for whom you inuire,
except once when I went in search of food as far as lyn lyw. And when
I came there, I struck my talons into a salmon, thinking he would serve
me as food for a long time. ut he drew me into the deep, and I was
scarcely able to escape from him. After that I went with my whole
kindred to attack him, and to try to destroy him, but he sent
messengers, and made peace with me and came and besought me to take
fifty fish spears out of his back. nless he know something of him whom
you seek, I cannot tell who may. owever, I will guide you to the place
where he is.â€â€

It happened that the almon did know. With every tide he went up the
evern as far as the walls of Gloucester, and there, he said, he had
found such wrong as he had never found anywhere else. o he took ai and
Gwrhyr upon his shoulders and carried them to the wall of the prison
where a captive was heard lamenting. his was Mabon son of Modron, who
was suffering such imprisonment as not even ludd of the ilver and or
Greid, the son of ri, the other two of the â€hree aramount
risoners of ritainâ€, had endured before him. ut it came to an end
now for ai sent to Arthur, and he and his warriors stormed Gloucester,
and brought Mabon away.

All was at last ready for the final achievementâ€”the hunting of wrch
rwyth, who was now, with his seven young pigs, in Ireland. efore he
was roused, it was thought wise to send the wizard Menw to find out by
ocular inspection whether the comb, the scissors, and the razor were
still between his ears. Menw took the form of a bird, and settled upon
the oarâ€s head. e saw the coveted treasures, and tried to take one of
them, but wrch rwyth shook himself so violently that some of the venom
from his bristles spurted over Menw, who was never uite well again from
that day.

hen the hunt was up, the men surrounded him, and the dogs were loosed
at him from every side. n the first day, the Irish attacked him. n the
second day, Arthurâ€s household encountered him and were worsted. hen
Arthur himself fought with him for nine days and nine nights without
even killing one of the little pigs.

A truce was now called, so that Gwrhyr, who spoke all languages, might
go and parley with him. Gwrhyr begged him to give up in peace the comb,
the scissors, and the razor, which were all that Arthur wanted. ut the
oar rwyth, indignant of having been so annoyed, would not. n the
contrary, he promised to go on the morrow into Arthurâ€s country, and do
all the harm he could there.

o wrch rwyth with his seven pigs crossed the sea into Wales, and
Arthur followed with his warriors in the ship â€rydwenâ€. ere the story
becomes wonderfully realistic and circumstantial. We are told of every
place they passed through on the long chase through outh Wales, and can
trace the course of the hunt over the map.0 We know of every check
the huntsmen had, and what happened every time the boars turned to bay.
he â€casualtylistâ€ of Arthurâ€s men is completely given and we can also
follow the shrinking of wrch rwythâ€s herd, as his little pigs fell one
by one. one were left but rwyth himself by the time the evern estuary
was reached, at the mouth of the Wye.

ere the hunt came up with him, and drove him into the water, and in
this unfamiliar element he was outmatched. sla ignife,
Manawyddan son of lyr, acmwri, the servant of Arthur, and Gwyngelli
caught him by his four feet and plunged his head under water, while the
two chief huntsmen, Mabon son of Modron, and yledyr Willt, came, one on
each side of him, and took the scissors and the razor. efore they could
get the comb, however, he shook himself free, and struck out for
Cornwall, leaving sla and acmwri halfdrowned in the evern.

And all this trouble, we are told, was mere play compared with the
trouble they had with him in Cornwall before they could get the comb.
ut, at last, they secured it, and drove the boar out over the deep sea.
e passed out of sight, with two of the magic hounds in pursuit of him,
and none of them have ever been heard of since.

he sight of these treasures, paraded before awthorn, chief of giants,
was, of course, his deathwarrant. All who wished him ill came to gloat
over his downfall. ut they should have been put to shame by the giant,
whose end had, at least, a certain dignity. â€My daughterâ€, he said to
ulhwch, â€is yours, but you need not thank me for it, but Arthur, who
has accomplished all this. y my free will you should never have had
her, for with her I lose my life.â€

hereupon they cut off his head, and put it upon a pole and that night
the undutiful lwen became ulhwchâ€s bride.

It is not, however, by such fragments of legend that Arthur is best
known to nglish readers. ot Arthur the god, but Arthur the â€blameless
kingâ€, who founded the able ound, from which he sent forth his knights
â€to ride abroad redressing human wrongsâ€,2 is the figure which the
name conures up. or is it even from ir homas Maloryâ€s Morte arthur
that this conception comes to most of us, but from ennysonâ€s Idylls of
the ing. ut ennyson has so modernized the ancient tradition that it
retains little of the old Arthur but the name. e tells us himself that
his poem had but very slight relation toâ€”

                 ... â€that gray king, whose name, a ghost,
         treams like a cloud, manshaped, from mountainpeak,
         And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still or him
         f Geoffreyâ€s book, or him of Malleorâ€s ...â€

but that he merely used the legend to give a substantial form to his
ideal figure of the perfect nglish gentlemanâ€”a title to which the
original Arthur could scarcely have laid claim. till less does there
remain in it the least trace of anything that could suggest mythology.

As much as this, however, might be said of Maloryâ€s book. We may be
fairly certain that the good ir homas had no idea that the personages
of whom he wrote had ever been anything different from the Christian
knights which they had become in the late rench romances from which he
compiled his own fifteenthcentury work. he old gods had been, from
time to time, very completely euhemerized. he characters of the â€our
ranches of the Mabinogiâ€ are still recognizable as divine beings. In
the later Welsh stories, however, their divinity merely hangs about them
in shreds and tatters, and the first orman adapters of these stories
made them still more definitely human. y the time Malory came to build
up his Morte arthur from the foreign romances, they had altered so much
that the shapes and deeds of gods could only be recognized under their
medival knightly disguises by those who had known them in their ancient
forms.

We have chosen Maloryâ€s Morte arthur, as almost the sole representative
of Arthurian literature later than the Welsh poems and prose stories,
for three reasons. irstly, because it is the nglish Arthurian romance
par excellence from which all later nglish authors, including
ennyson, have drawn their material. econdly, because the mass of
foreign literature dealing with the subect of Arthur is in itself a
lifestudy, and could not by any possibility be compressed within the
limits of a chapter. hirdly, because Maloryâ€s fine udgment caused him
to choose the best and most typical foreign tales to weave into his own
romance and hence it is that we find most of our old ritish godsâ€”both
those of the earlier cycle and those of the system connected with
Arthurâ€”striding disguised through his pages.

Curiously enough, ir dward trachey, in his preface to the â€Globeâ€
edition of Caxtonâ€s Morte arthur, uses almost the same image to
describe Maloryâ€s prosepoem that Matthew Arnold handled with such
effect, in his tudy of Celtic iterature, to point out the real
nature of the Mabinogion. â€Maloryâ€, he says, â€has built a great,
rambling, medival castle, the walls of which enclose rude and even
ruinous work of earlier times.â€ ow rude and how ruinous these relics
were Malory doubtless had not the least idea, for he has completely
umbled the ancient mythology. ot only do gods of the older and newer
order appear together, but the same deities, under very often only
slightly varying names, come up again and again as totally different
characters.

ake, for example, the ancient deity of death and ades. As ing
randegore, or randegoris rn of Gower, he brings five thousand
mounted men to oppose ing Arthur but, as ir randel, or
randiles rn of Gwales, he is a valiant night of the ound
able, who dies fighting in Arthurâ€s service. Again, under his name
of ther endragon ther en, he is Arthurâ€s father though as
ing an of enwyk the â€uare nclosureâ€, doubtless the same as
aliesinâ€s Caer edryvan and Maloryâ€s Carbonek, he is a foreign
monarch, who is Arthurâ€s ally. Yet again, as the father of
Guinevere, gyrvran has become eodegrance. As ing riens, or
rience, of Gore Gower, he marries one of Arthurâ€s sisters,0
fights against him, but finally tenders his submission, and is enrolled
among his knights. rien may also be identified in the Morte
arthur as ing ience, or yons, of orth Wales,2 and as ing
entres of Garloth while, to crown the varied disguises of this
roteus of ritish gods, he appears in an isolated episode as alan, who
fights with his brother alin until they kill one another.

ne may generally tell the divinities of the underworld in these
romances by their connection, not with the settled and civilized parts
of ngland, but with the wild and remote north and west, and the still
wilder and remoter islands. ust as rn and rien are kings of Gower,
so Arawn, under the corruptions of his name into â€Anguishâ€ and
â€Anguissanceâ€, is made ing of cotland or Ireland, both countries
having been probably confounded, as the same land of the cotti, or
Gaels. wyll, ead of Annwn, we likewise discover under two
disguises. As elles, â€ing of the oreign Countryâ€ and eeper of
the oly Grail, he is a personage of great mythological significance,
albeit the real nature of him and his surroundings has been overlaid
with a Christian veneer as foreign to the original of elles as his own
kingdom was to Arthurâ€s knights. he Chief of ades figures as a â€cousin
nigh unto oseph of Arimathieâ€, who, â€while he might ride supported
much Christendom, and holy churchâ€. e is represented as the father
of layne len, whom he gives in marriage to ir auncelot,
bestowing upon the couple a residence called â€Castle liantâ€,0 the
name of which, there is good evidence to show, is connected with that of
wyllâ€s vassal called eirnyon wryf liant in the first of the
Mabinogi. nder his other name of â€ir elleasâ€â€”the hero of
ennysonâ€s Idyll of elleas and ttarreâ€”the primitive myth of wyll is
touched at a different point. After his unfortunate lovepassage with
ttarre or ttard, as Malory calls her, elleas is represented as
marrying imue,2 whose original name, which was hiannon, reached
this form, as well as that of â€ivienâ€, through a series of miscopyings
of successive scribes.

With elles, or elleas, is associated a ing ellean, or ellam, his
son, and, eually with him, the eeper of the Grail, who can be no other
than ryderi. ike that deity in the Mabinogi of Mth, he is
defeated by one of the gods of light. he dealer of the blow, however,
is not Arthur, as successor to Gwydion, but alin, the Galloritish
sungod elinus.

Another dark deity, Gwyn son of udd, we discover under all of his three
titles. Called variously â€ir Gwinasâ€, â€ir Guynasâ€, and â€ir
Gwenbausâ€ by Malory, the Welsh Gwynwas or Gwyn is altogether on
Arthurâ€s side. he Cornish Melwas, split into two different knights,
divides his allegiance. As ir Melias, or Meleaus,0 de ile
â€of the Isleâ€, he is a night of the ound able, though, on the
uarrel between Arthur and auncelot, he sides with the knight against
the king. ut as ir Meliagraunce, or Meliagaunce, it is he who, as in
the older myth, captures ueen Guinevere and carries her off to his
castle. nder his omerset name of Avallon, or Avallach, he is
connected with the episode of the Grail. ing velake2 is a aracen
ruler who was converted by oseph of Arimathea, and brought by him to
ritain. In his convertâ€s enthusiasm, he attempted the uest of the holy
vessel, but was not allowed to succeed. As a consolation, however,
it was divinely promised him that he should not die until he had seen a
knight of his blood in the ninth degree who should achieve it. his was
done by ir ercivale, ing velake being then three hundred years
old.

urning from deities of darkness to deities of light, we find the
skygod figuring largely in the Morte arthur. he ludd of the earlier
mythology is Maloryâ€s ing oth, or ot, of rkney, through an
intrigue with whose wife Arthur becomes the father of ir Mordred. otâ€s
wife was the mother also of ir Gawain, whose birth Malory does not,
however, attribute to Arthur, though such must have been the original
form of the myth. ir Gawain, of the Arthurian legend, is the
Gwalchmei of the Welsh stories, the successor of the still earlier leu
law Gyffes, ust as ir Mordredâ€”the Welsh Medrawtâ€”corresponds to leuâ€s
brother ylan. As ir Mordred retains the dark character of Medrawt, so
ir Gawain, even in Malory, shows the attributes of a solar deity.
We are told that his strength increased gradually from dawn till high
noon, and then as gradually decreased againâ€”a piece of pagan symbolism
which forms a good example of the appositeness of ir dward tracheyâ€s
figure for it stands out of the medival narrative like an ancient
brick in some more modern building.

he eus of the later cycle, mrys or Myrddin, appears in the Morte
arthur under both his names. he word â€mrysâ€ becomes â€orsâ€, and ing
ors of Gaul is made a brother of ing an of enwyckâ€”that is, rn
of the uare nclosure, the ubiuitous underworld god. Myrddin we meet
under no such disguise. he everpopular Merlin still retains intact the
attributes of the skygod. e remains above, and apart from all the
knights, higher even in some respects than ing Arthur, to whom he
stands in much the same position as Mth does to Gwydion in the
Mabinogi. ike Mth, he is an enchanter, and, like Mth, too, who
could hear everything said in the world, in however low a tone, if only
the wind met it, he is practically omniscient. he account of his final
disappearance, as told in the Morte arthur, is only a reembellishment
of the original story, the naturemyth giving place to what novelists
call â€a feminine interestâ€. veryone knows how the great magician fell
into a dotage upon the â€lady of the lakeâ€ whom Malory calls â€imueâ€, and
ennyson â€ivienâ€â€”both names being that of â€hiannonâ€ in disguise.
â€Merlin would let her have no rest, but always he would be with her ...
and she was ever passing weary of him, and fain would have been
delivered of him, for she was afeard of him because he was a devilâ€s
son, and she could not put him away by no means. And so on a time it
happed that Merlin showed to her in a rock whereas was a great wonder,
and wrought by enchantment, that went under a great stone. o, by her
subtle working, she made Merlin to go under that stone to let her wit of
the marvels there, but she wrought so there for him that he never came
out for all the craft that he could do. And so she departed and left
Merlin.â€0

Merlinâ€s living grave is still to be seen at the end of the al des
es, in the forest of rcilien, in rittany. he tomb of stone is
certainly but a prosaic euivalent for the tower of woven air in which
the heavengod went to his rest. till, it is not uite so unpoetic as
the leather sack in which hiannon, the original of imue, caught and
imprisoned Gwawl, the earlier Merlin, like a badger in a bag.

len, Myrddinâ€s consort, appears in Malory as five different â€lainesâ€.
wo of them are wives of the dark god, under his names of â€ing
anâ€2 and â€ing entresâ€. A third is called the daughter of
ing ellinore, a character of uncertain origin. ut the two most
famous are the ladies who loved ir auncelotâ€”â€laine the air, laine
the lovable, laine the lily maid of Astolatâ€, and the luckier and
less scrupulous laine, daughter of ing elles, and mother of ir
auncelotâ€s son, Galahad.

ut it is time, now that the most important figures of ritish mythology
have been shown under their knightly disguises, and their place in
Arthurian legend indicated, to pass on to some account of the real
subectmatter of ir homas Maloryâ€s romance. xternally, it is the
history of an Arthur, ing of ritain, whom most people of Maloryâ€s time
considered as eminently a historical character. Around this central
narrative of Arthurâ€s reign and deeds are grouped, in the form of
episodes, the personal exploits of the knights believed to have
supported him by forming a kind of household guard. ut, with the
exception of a little magnified and distorted legendary history, the
whole cycle of romance may be ultimately resolved into a few myths, not
only retold, but recombined in several forms by their various tellers.
he orman adapters of the Matire de retagne found the ritish
mythology already in process of transformation, some of the gods having
dwindled into human warriors, and others into hardly less human druids
and magicians. nder their hands the ritish warriors became orman
knights, who did their deeds of prowess in the tiltyard, and found
their inspiration in the fantastic chivalry popularized by the
rouveres, while the druids put off their still somewhat barbaric
druidism for the more conventional magic of the atin races. More than
this, as soon as the real seuence and raison dâ€tre of the tales had
been lost sight of, their adapters used a free hand in reweaving them.
Most of the romancers had their favourite characters whom they made the
central figure in their stories. ir Gawain, ir ercival, ir ristrem,
and ir wain all of them probably once local ritish sungods appear
as the most important personages of the romances called after their
names, stories of the doughty deeds of christened knights who had little
left about them either of riton or of pagan.

It is only the labours of the modern scholar that can bring back to us,
at this late date, things long forgotten when Maloryâ€s book was issued
from Caxtonâ€s press. ut oblivion is not annihilation, and rofessor
hys points out to us the old myths lying embedded in their later
setting with almost the same certainty with which the geologist can show
us the fossils in the rock. hus treated, they resolve themselves
into three principal motifs, prominent everywhere in Celtic mythology
the birth of the sungod the struggle between light and darkness and
the raiding of the underworld by friendly gods for the good of man.

he first has been already dealt with. It is the retelling of the
story of the origin of the sungod in the Mabinogi of Mth, son of
Mthonwy. or Gwydion we now have Arthur instead of Arianrod, the wife
of the superannuated skygod wyvre, we find the wife of ing ot, the
superannuated skygod ludd leu law Gyffes rises again as ir Gawain
Gwalchmei, and ylan as ir Mordred Medrawt while the wise Merlin,
the upiter of the new system, takes the place of his wise prototype,
Mth. Connected with this first myth is the secondâ€”the struggle between
light and darkness, of which there are several versions in the Morte
arthur. he leading one is the rebellion of the evillydisposed ir
Mordred against Arthur and ir Gawain while, on other stages, alanâ€”the
dark god rnâ€”fights with alinâ€”the sungod elinus and the same alin,
or elinus, gives an almost mortal stroke to ellam, the ryderi of the
older mythology.

he same myth has also a wider form, in which the battle is waged for
possession of a maiden. hus to seek no other instances Gwynhwyvar was
contended for by Arthur and Medrawt, or, in an earlier form of the myth,
by Arthur and Gwyn. In the Morte arthur, Gwyn, under the corruption of
his Cornish name Melwas into â€ir Meliagraunceâ€, still captures
Guinevere, but it is no longer Arthur who rescues her. hat task, or
privilege, has fallen to a new champion. It is ir auncelot who follows
ir Meliagraunce, defeats and slays him, and rescues the fair
captive. ut ir auncelot, it must be statedâ€”probably to the
surprise of those to whom the Arthurian story without auncelot and
ueen Guinevere must seem almost like the play of â€amlet with amlet
left outâ€,â€”is unknown to the original tradition. Welsh song and story
are silent with regard to him, and he is not improbably a creation of
some orman romancer who calmly appropriated to his heroâ€s credit deeds
earlier told of other â€knightsâ€.

ut the romantic treatment of these two myths by the adapters of the
Matire de retagne are of smaller interest to us at the present day
than that of the third. he attraction of the Arthurian story lies less
in the battles of Arthur or the loves of Guinevere than in the legend
that has given it its lasting popularityâ€”the Christian romance of the
uest of the oly Grail. o great and various has been the inspiration
of this legend to noble works both of art and literature that it seems
almost a kind of sacrilege to trace it back, like all the rest of
Arthurâ€s story, to a paganism which could not have even understood, much
less created, its mystical beauty. one the less is the whole story
directly evolved from primitive pagan myths concerning a miraculous
cauldron of fertility and inspiration.

In the later romances, the oly Grail is a Christian relic of marvellous
potency. It had held the aschal lamb eaten at the ast upper00
and, after the death of Christ, oseph of Arimathea had filled it with
the aviourâ€s blood.0 ut before it received this colouring, it had
been the magic cauldron of all the Celtic mythologiesâ€”the agdaâ€s
â€ndryâ€ which fed all who came to it, and from which none went away
unsatisfied02 rnâ€s cauldron of enovation, which brought the dead
back to life0 the cauldron of gyrvran the Giant, from which the
Muses ascended0 the cauldrons captured by Cuchulainn from the ing
of the hadowy City,0 and by Arthur from the chief of ades0 as
well as several other mythic vessels of less note.

In its transition from pagan to Christian form, hardly one of the
features of the ancient myth has been really obscured. We may recount
the chief attributes, as aliesin tells them in his â€poiling of Annwnâ€,
of the cauldron captured by Arthur. It was the property of wyll, and of
his son ryderi, who lived in a kingdom of the other world called, among
other titles, the â€evolving Castleâ€, the â€ourcornered Castleâ€, the
â€Castle of evelryâ€, the â€ingly Castleâ€, the â€Glass Castleâ€, and the
â€Castle of ichesâ€. his place was surrounded by the sea, and in other
ways made difficult of access there was no lack of wine there, and its
happy inhabitants spent with music and feasting an existence which
neither disease nor old age could assail. As for the cauldron, it had a
rim of pearls around its edge the fire beneath it was kept fanned by
the breaths of nine maidens it spoke, doubtless in words of prophetic
wisdom and it would not cook the food of a perurer or coward.0
ere we have considerable data on which to base a parallel between the
pagan cauldron and the Christian Grail.

or have we far to go in search of correspondences, for they are nearly
all preserved in Maloryâ€s romance. he mystic vessel was kept by ing
elles, who is wyll, in a castle called â€Carbonekâ€, a name which
resolves itself, in the hands of the philologist, into Caer bannawg,
the â€suareâ€ or â€fourcornered castleâ€â€”in other words, the Caer
edryvan of aliesinâ€s poem.0 f the character of the place as a
â€Castle of ichesâ€ and a â€Castle of evelryâ€, where â€bright wine was the
drink of the hostâ€, we have more than a hint in the account, twice
given,0 of how, upon the appearance of the Grailâ€”borne, it should be
noticed, by a maiden or angelâ€”the hall was filled with good odours, and
every knight found on the table all the kinds of meat and drink he could
imagine as most desirable. It could not be seen by sinners,0 a
Christian refinement of the savage idea of a pot that would not cook a
cowardâ€s food but the sight of it alone would cure of wounds and
sickness those who approached it faithfully and humbly, and in its
presence neither old age nor sickness could oppress them.2 And,
though in Malory we find no reference either to the spot having been
surrounded by water, or to the castle as a â€revolvingâ€ one, we have only
to turn from the Morte arthur to the romance entitled the eint Greal
to discover both. Gwalchmei, going to the castle of ing eleur
ryderi, finds it encircled by a great water, while eredur,
approaching the same place, sees it turning with greater speed than the
swiftest wind. Moreover, archers on the walls shoot so vigorously that
no armour can resist their shafts, which explains how it happened that,
of those that went with Arthur, â€except seven, none returned from Caer
idiâ€.

It is noticeable that Arthur himself never attempts the uest of the
Grail, though it was he who had achieved its pagan original. We find in
Malory four competitors for the mantle of Arthurâ€”ir elleas, ir
ors, ir ercivale, and ir Galahad. he first of these may be put
out of court at once, ir elleas, who, being himself elles, or wyll,
the keeper of it, could have had no reason for such exertions. At the
second we may look doubtfully for ir ors is no other than mrys, or
Myrddin, and, casting back to the earlier ritish mythology, we do
not find the skygod personally active in securing boons by force or
craft from the underworld. he other two have better claimsâ€”ir
ercivale and ir Galahad. â€ir ercivaleâ€ is the ormanrench name for
eredur, the hero of a story in the ed ook of ergest which
gives the oldest form of a Grail uest we have. It is anterior to the
orman romances, and forms almost a connectinglink between tales of
mythology and of chivalry. eredur, or ir ercivale, therefore, is the
oldest, most primitive, of Grail seekers. n the other hand, ir Galahad
is the latest and youngest. ut there is reason to believe that Galahad,
in Welsh â€Gwalchavedâ€, the â€alcon of ummerâ€, is the same solar hero as
Gawain, in Welsh â€Gwalchmeiâ€, the â€alcon of Mayâ€. oth are made,
in the story of â€ulhwch and lwenâ€, sons of the same mother, Gwyar. ir
Gawain himself is, in one Arthurian romance, the achiever of the
Grail.20 It is needless to attempt to choose between these two. oth
have the attributes of sungods. Gwalchmei, the successor of leu law
Gyffes, and eredur aladrhir, that is to say, the â€pearman with the
ong haftâ€,2 may be allowed to claim eual honours. What is
important is that the uest of the Grail, once the chief treasure of
ades, is still accomplished by one who takes in later legend the place
of ieu law Gyffes and ugh amhfada in the earlier ritish and Gaelic
myths as a longarmed solar deity victorious in his strife against the
owers of arkness.

If there be love of fame in celestial minds, those gods might count
themselves fortunate who shared in the transformation of Arthur. heir
divinity had fallen from them, but in their new rles, as heroes of
romance, they entered upon vivid reincarnations. he names of Arthurâ€s
nights might almost be described as â€household wordsâ€, while the gods
who had no portion in the able ound are known only to those who busy
themselves with antiuarian lore. It is true that a few folktales still
survive in the remoter parts of Wales, in which the names of such
ancient ritish deities as Gwydion, Gwyn, Arianrod, and ylan appear,
but it is in such a chaos of umbled and distorted legend that one finds
it hard to pick out even the slenderest thread of story. hey have none
of the definite coherence of the contemporary Gaelic folktales uoted
in a previous chapter as still preserving the myths about Goibniu, ugh,
Cian, Manannn, thniu, and alor. Indeed, they have reached such a
stage of disintegration that they can hardly now survive another
generation.22

here have been, however, other paths by which the fame of a god might
descend to a posterity which would no longer credit his divinity. he
rolls of early ritish history were open to welcome any number of
mythical personages, provided that their legends were attractive.
Geoffrey of Monmouthâ€s famous istoria ritonum is, under its grave
pretence of exact history, as mythological as the Morte arthur, or even
the Mabinogion. he annals of early ritish saintship were not less
accommodating. A god whose tradition was too potent to be ignored or
extinguished was canonized, as a matter of course, by clerics who held
as an axiom that â€the toleration of the cromlech facilitated the
reception of the Gospel.2â€ nly the most irreconcilable escaped
themâ€”such a one as Gwyn son of udd, who, found almost useless by
Geoffrey and intractable by the monkish writers, remains the last
survivor of the old godsâ€”dwindled to the proportions of a fairy, but
unsubdued.

his part of resistance is perhaps the most dignified for deities can
be sadly changed by the caprices of their euhemerizers. n, whom we
knew as the mother of the heaven gods, seems strangely described as a
king of ochlin and ublin, who led the Irish into north Wales in A..
2.2 More recognizable is his son Gwydion, who introduced the
knowledge of letters into the country of his adoption. he dynasty of
â€ingâ€ n, according to a manuscript in the collection of Mr. dward
Williamsâ€”better known under his bardic name of Iolo Morganwgâ€”held north
Wales for a hundred and twentynine years, when the orth ritish king,
Cunedda, invaded the country, defeated the Irish in a great battle, and
drove them across sea to the Isle of Man. his battle is historical,
and, putting n and Gwydion out of the uestion, probably represented
the last stand of the Gael, in the extreme west of ritain, against the
second and stronger wave of Celtic invasion. In the same collection of
Iolo Manuscripts is found a curious, and even comic, euhemeristic
version of the strange myth of the one rison of eth and Anoeth which
Manawyddan son of lyr, built in Gower. he new reading makes that
ghastly abode a real building, constructed out of the bones of the
â€Caesariansâ€ omans killed in battle with the Cymri. It consisted of
numerous chambers, some of large bones and some of small, some above
ground and some under. risoners of war were placed in the more
comfortable cells, the underground dungeons being kept for traitors to
their country. everal times the â€Caesariansâ€ demolished the prison,
but, each time, the Cymri rebuilt it stronger than before. At last,
however, the bones decayed, and, being spread upon the ground, made an
excellent manure â€rom that time forthâ€ the people of the neighbourhood
â€had astonishing crops of wheat and barley and of every other grain for
many yearsâ€.2

It is not, however, in these, so to speak, unauthorized narratives that
we can best refind our ritish deities, but in the compact, coherent,
and at times almost convincing istoria ritonum of Geoffrey of
Monmouth, published in the first half of the twelfth century, and for
hundreds of years gravely uoted as the leading authority on the early
history of our islands. he modern critical spirit has, of course,
relegated it to the region of fable. We can no longer accept the
pleasant tradition of the descent of the ritons from the survivors of
roy, led westward in search of a new home by rutus, the greatgrandson
of the pious neas. or indeed does any portion of the â€istoryâ€, from
neas to Athelstan, uite persuade the latterday reader. Its kings
succeed one another in plausible seuence, but they themselves are too
obviously the heroes of popular legend.

A large part of Geoffreyâ€s chronicleâ€”two books2 out of twelveâ€”is, of
course, devoted to Arthur. In it he tells the story of that paladinâ€s
conuests, not only in his own country, against the axons, the Irish,
the cots, and the icts, but over all western urope. We see the
ritish champion, after annexing Ireland, Iceland, Gothland, and the
rkneys, following up these minor victories by subduing orway, acia
by which enmark seems to have been meant, Auitaine, and Gaul. After
such triumphs there was clearly nothing left for him but the overthrow
of the oman empire and this he had practically achieved when the
rebellion of Mordred brought him home to his death, or rather for even
Geoffrey does not uite lose hold of the belief in the undying Arthur
to be carried to the island of Avallon to be healed of his wounds, the
crown of ritain falling to â€his kinsman Constantine, the son of Cador,
uke of Cornwall, in the five hundred and fortysecond year of our
ordâ€s incarnationâ€.2 pon the more personal incidents connected
with Arthur, Geoffrey openly professes to keep silence, possibly
regarding them as not falling within the province of his history, but we
are told shortly how Mordred took advantage of Arthurâ€s absence on the
Continent to seize the throne, marry Guanhamara Guinevere, and ally
himself with the axons, only to be defeated at that fatal battle called
by Geoffrey â€Cambulaâ€, in which Mordred, Arthur, and Walganâ€”the â€ir
Gawainâ€ of Malory and the Gwalchmei of the earlier legendsâ€”all met their
dooms.

We find the gods of the older generation standing in the same position
with regard to Arthur in Geoffreyâ€s â€istoryâ€ as they do in the later
Welsh triads and tales. hough rulers, they are yet his vassals. In
â€three brothers of royal bloodâ€, called ot, rian, and Augusel, who are
represented as having been chiefs in the north, we may discern ludd,
rien, and Arawn. o these three Arthur restored â€the rights of their
ancestorsâ€, handing over the semisovereignty of cotland to Augusel,
giving rian the government of Murief Moray, and reestablishing ot
â€in the consulship of oudonesia othian, and the other provinces
belonging to himâ€.2 wo other rulers subect to him are Gunvasius,
ing of the rkneys, and Malvasius, ing of Iceland,2 in whom we
recognize Gwyn, under atinized forms of his Welsh name Gwynwas and his
Cornish name Melwas. ut it is characteristic of Geoffrey of Monmouthâ€s
loose hold upon his materials that, not content with having connected
several of these gods with Arthurâ€s period, he further endows them with
reigns of their own. â€rienâ€ was Arthurâ€s vassal, but â€rianusâ€ was
himself ing of ritain centuries before Arthur was born.0 ud that
is, ludd succeeded his father eli. We hear nothing of his silver
hand, but we learn that he was â€famous for the building of cities, and
for rebuilding the walls of rinovantum2, which he also surrounded
with innumerable towers ... and though he had many other cities, yet he
loved this above them all, and resided in it the greater part of the
year for which reason it was afterwards called aerlud, and by the
corruption of the word, Caerlondon and again by change of languages, in
process of time, ondon as also by foreigners who arrived here, and
reduced this country under their subection, it was called ondres. At
last, when he was dead, his body was buried by the gate which to this
time is called in the ritish tongue after his name arthlud, and in the
axon, udesgata.â€ e was succeeded by his brother, Cassibellawn
Cassivelaunus, during whose reign ulius Caesar first invaded ritain.

ludd, however, is not entirely dependent upon Geoffrey of Monmouth for
his reputation as a king of ritain. ne of the old Welsh romances,
translated by ady Charlotte Guest in her Mabinogion, relates the
rebuilding of ondon by ludd in almost the same words as Geoffrey. he
story which these pseudohistorical details introduce is, however, an
obviously mythological one. It tells us how, in the days of ludd,
ritain was oppressed by three plagues. he first was the arrival of a
strange race of sorcerers called the â€Coraniansâ€, who had three
ualities which made them unpopular they paid their way in â€fairy
moneyâ€, which, though apparently real, returned afterwardsâ€”like the
shields, horses, and hounds made by Gwydion son of n, to deceive
ryderiâ€”into the fungus out of which it had been charmed by magic they
could hear everything that was said over the whole of ritain, in
however low a tone, provided only that the wind met it and they could
not be inured by any weapon. he second was â€a shriek that came on
every May eve, over every hearth in the Island of ritain, and went
through peopleâ€s hearts and so scared them that the men lost their hue
and their strength, and the women their children, and the young men and
the maidens their senses, and all the animals and trees and the earth
and the waters were left barrenâ€. he third was a disappearance of the
food hoarded in the kingâ€s palace, which was so complete that a yearâ€s
provisions vanished in a single night, and so mysterious that no one
could ever find out its cause.

y the advice of his nobles, ludd went to rance to obtain the help of
its king, his brother levelys, who was â€a man great of counsel and
wisdomâ€. In order to be able to consult with his brother without being
overheard by the Coranians, levelys caused a long tube of brass to be
made, through which they talked to one another. he sorcerer tribe,
however, got to know of it, and, though they could not hear what was
being said inside the speakingtube, they sent a demon into it, who
whispered insulting messages up and down it, as though from one brother
to the other. ut ludd and levelys knew one another too well to be
deceived by this, and they drove the demon out of the tube by flooding
it with wine. hen levelys told ludd to take certain insects, which he
would give him, and pound them in water. When the water was sufficiently
permeated with their essence, he was to call both his own people and the
Coranians together, as though for a conference, and, in the midst of the
meeting, to cast it over all of them alike. he water, though harmless
to his own people, would nevertheless prove a deadly poison to the
Coranians.

As for the shriek, levelys explained it to be raised by a dragon. his
monster was the ed ragon of ritain, and it raised the shriek because
it was being attacked by the White ragon of the axons, which was
trying to overcome and destroy it. he rench king told his brother to
measure the length and breadth of ritain, and, when he had found the
exact centre of the island, to cause a pit to be dug there. In this pit
was to be placed a vessel containing the best mead that could be made,
with a covering of satin over it to hide it. ludd was then to watch
from some safe place. he dragons would appear and fight in the air
until they were exhausted, then they would fall together on to the top
of the satin cloth, and so draw it down with them into the vessel full
of mead. aturally they would drink the mead, and, eually naturally,
they would then sleep. As soon as ludd was sure that they were
helpless, he was to go to the pit, wrap the satin cloth round both of
them, and bury them together in a stone coffin in the strongest place in
ritain. If this were safely done, there would be no more heard of the
shriek.

And the disappearance of the food was caused by â€a mighty man of magicâ€,
who put everyone to sleep by charms before he removed the kingâ€s
provisions. ludd was to watch for him, sitting by the side of a
cauldron full of cold water. As often as he felt the approach of
drowsiness, he was to plunge into the cauldron. hus he would be able to
keep awake and frustrate the thief.

o ludd came back to ritain. e pounded the insects in the water, and
then summoned both the men of ritain and the Coranians to a meeting. In
the midst of it, he sprinkled the water over everyone alike. he natives
took no harm from this mythological â€beetle powderâ€, but the Coranians
died.

ludd was then ready to deal with the dragons. is careful measurements
proved that the centre of the island of ritain was at xford, and there
he caused the pit to be dug, with the vessel of mead in it, hidden by
the satin covering. aving made everything ready, he watched, and soon
saw the dragons appear. or a long time they fought desperately in the
air then they fell down together on to the satin cloth, and, drawing it
after them, subsided into the mead. ludd waited till they were uite
silent, and then pulled them out, folded them carefully in the wrapping,
and took them to the district of nowdon, where he buried them in the
strong fortress whose remains, near eddgelert, are still called â€inas
mrysâ€. After this the terrible shriek was not heard again until Merlin
had them dug up, five hundred years later, when they recommenced
fighting, and the red dragon drove the white one out of ritain.

ast of all, ludd prepared a great banuet in his hall, and watched
over it, armed, with the cauldron of water near him. In the middle of
the night, he heard soft, drowsy music, such as nearly put him to sleep
but he kept awake by repeatedly dipping himself in the cold water. ust
before dawn a huge man, clad in armour, came into the hall, carrying a
basket, which he began to load with the viands on the table. ike the
bag in which wyll captured Gwawl, its holding capacity seemed endless.
owever, the man filled it at last, and was carrying it out, when ludd
stopped him. hey fought, and ludd conuered the man of magic, and made
him his vassal. hus the â€hree lagues of ritainâ€ came to an end.

ludd, in changing from god to king, seems to have lost most of his old
mythological attributes. ven his daughter Creudylad is taken from him
and given to another of the ancient ritish deities. Why ludd, the
skygod, should have been confounded with lyr, the seagod, is not very
apparent, but it is certain that â€Creudyladâ€ of the early Welsh legends
and poems is the same as Geoffreyâ€s â€Cordeillaâ€ and hakespeareâ€s
â€Cordeliaâ€. he great dramatist was ultimately indebted to the Celtic
mythology for the groundwork of the legend which he wove into the tragic
story of ing ear. â€eirâ€, as Geoffrey calls him, was the son of
ladud, who built Caer adus ath, and perished, like Icarus, as the
result of an accident with a flyingmachine of his own invention. aving
no sons, but three daughters, Gonorilla, egan, and Cordeilla, he
thought in his old age of dividing his kingdom among them. ut, first of
all, he decided to make trial of their affection for him, with the idea
of giving the best portions of his realm to the most worthy. Gonorilla,
the eldest, replied to his uestion of how much she loved him, â€that she
called heaven to witness, she loved him more than her own soulâ€. egan
answered â€with an oath, â€that she could not otherwise express her
thoughts, but that she loved him above all creaturesâ€â€. ut when it came
to Cordeillaâ€s turn, the youngest daughter, disgusted with her sistersâ€
hypocrisy, spoke after a uite different fashion. â€â€My father,â€ said
she, â€is there any daughter that can love her father more than duty
reuires In my opinion, whoever pretends to it, must disguise her real
sentiments under the veil of flattery. I have always loved you as a
father, nor do I yet depart from my purposed duty and if you insist to
have something more extorted from me, hear now the greatness of my
affection, which I always bear you, and take this for a short answer to
all your uestions look how much you have, so much is your value, and
so much do I love you.â€â€ er enraged father immediately bestowed his
kingdom upon his two other daughters, marrying them to the two highest
of his nobility, Gonorilla to Maglaunus, uke of Albania, and egan
to enuinus, uke of Cornwall. o Cordeilla he not only refused a share
in his realm, but even a dowry. Aganippus, ing of the ranks, married
her, however, for her beauty alone.

nce in possession, eirâ€s two sonsinlaw rebelled against him, and
deprived him of all regal authority. he sole recompense for his lost
power was an agreement by Maglaunus to allow him maintenance, with a
bodyguard of sixty soldiers. ut, after two years, the uke of Albania,
at his wife Gonorillaâ€s instigation, reduced them to thirty. esenting
this, eir left Maglaunus, and went to enuinus, the husband of egan.
he uke of Cornwall at first received him honourably, but, before a
year was out, compelled him to discharge all his attendants except five.
his sent him back in a rage to his eldest daughter, who, this time,
swore that he should not stay with her, unless he would be satisfied
with one servingman only. In despair, eir resolved to throw himself
upon the mercy of Cordeilla, and, full of contrition for the way he had
treated her, and of misgivings as to how he might be received, took ship
for Gaul.

Arriving at aritia, he sent a messenger to his daughter, telling
her of his plight and asking for her help. Cordeilla sent him money,
robes, and a retinue of forty men, and, as soon as he was fully euipped
with the state suitable to a king, he was received in pomp by Aganippus
and his ministers, who gave the government of Gaul into his hands until
his own kingdom could be restored to him. his the king of the ranks
did by raising an army and invading ritain. Maglaunus and enuinus were
routed, and eir replaced on the throne, after which he lived three
years. Cordeilla, succeeding to the government of ritain, â€buried her
father in a certain vault, which she ordered to be made for him under
the iver ore, in eicester â€lyrcestreâ€, and which had been built
originally under the ground to the honour of the god anus. And here all
the workmen of the city, upon the anniversary solemnity of that
festival, used to begin their yearly labours.â€

xactly what myth is retold in this history of eir and his three
daughters we are hardly likely ever to discover. ut its mythological
nature is clear enough in the light of the description of the
underground temple dedicated to lyr, at once the god of the subaueous,
and therefore subterranean, world and a ritish is ater, connected
with the origin of things, like the oman god anus, with whom he was
apparently identified.

en kings or so after this for any more exact way of measuring the
flight of time is absent from Geoffreyâ€s istory we recognize two
other ritish gods upon the scene. rennius that is, rn disputes the
kingdom with his brother elinus. Clearly this is a version of the
ancient myth of the twin brothers, arkness and ight, which we have
seen expressed in so many ways in Celtic mythology. rn, the god of
death and the underworld, is opposed to elinus, god of the sun and
health. In the original, lost myth, probably they alternately conuered
and were conueredâ€”a symbol of the alternation of night and day and of
winter and summer. In Geoffreyâ€s istory, they divided ritain,
elinus taking â€the crown of the island with the dominions of oegria,
ambria, and Cornwall, because, according to the roan constitution,
the right of inheritance would come to him as the elderâ€, while
rennius, as the younger, had â€orthumberland, which extended from the
iver umber to Caithnessâ€. ut flatterers persuaded rennius to ally
himself with the ing of the orwegians, and attack elinus. A battle
was fought, in which elinus was conueror, and rennius escaped to
Gaul, where he married the daughter of the uke of the Allobroges, and
on that rulerâ€s death was declared successor to the throne. hus firmly
established with an army, he invaded ritain again. elinus marched with
the whole strength of the kingdom to meet him, and the armies were
already drawn out opposite to one another in battle array when Conwenna,
the mother of the two kings, succeeded in reconciling them. ot having
one another to fight with, the brothers now agreed upon a oint
expedition with their armies into Gaul. he ritons and the Allobroges
conuered all the other kings of the ranks, and then entered Italy,
destroying villages and cities as they marched to ome. Gabius and
orsena, the oman consuls, bought them off with large presents of gold
and silver and the promise of a yearly tribute, whereupon rennius and
elinus withdrew their army into Germany and began to devastate it. ut
the omans, now no longer taken by surprise and unprepared, came to the
help of the Germans. his brought rennius and elinus back to ome,
which, after a long siege, they succeeded in taking. rennius remained
in Italy, â€where he exercised unheardof tyranny over the peopleâ€ and
one may take the whole of this veracious history to be due to a
patriotic desire to make out the rennus of â€ae ictisâ€ fameâ€”who
actually did sack ome, in .C. 0â€”a riton. elinus, the other
brother, returned to ngland. â€e made a gate of wonderful structure in
rinovantum, upon the bank of the hames, which the citizens call after
his name illingsgate to this day. ver it he built a prodigiously large
tower, and under it a haven or uay for ships.... At last, when he had
finished his days, his body was burned, and the ashes put up in a golden
urn, which they placed at rinovantum, with wonderful art, on the top of
the tower above mentioned.â€ e was succeeded by Gurgiunt rabtruc,0
who, as he was returning by way of the rkneys from a raid on the anes,
met the ships of artholon and his people as they came from pain to
settle in Ireland.

lyr and his children, large as they bulk in mythical history, were
hardly less illustrious as saints. he family of lyr lediath is always
described by the early Welsh hagiologists as the first of the â€hree
chief oly amilies of the Isle of ritainâ€. he glory of lyr himself,
however, is but a reflected one for it was his son rn â€the lessdâ€
who actually introduced Christianity into ritain. egend tells us that
he was taken captive to ome with his son Caradawc who was identified
for the purpose with the historical Caratacus, and the rest of his
family, and remained there seven years, during which time he became
converted to the Gospel, and spread it enthusiastically on his return.
either his son Caradawc nor his halfbrother Manawyddan exactly
followed in his footsteps, but their descendants did. Caradawcâ€s sons
were all saintly, while his daughter igen, who married a chief called
arrlog, lord of Caer arrlog ld arum, was the first female saint in
ritain. Manawyddanâ€s side of the family was less adaptable. is son and
his grandson were both pagans, but his greatgrandson obtained Christian
fame as t. yfan, who was sent as a bishop to Wales by ope
leutherius, and was martyred at Merthyr yvan. After this, the saintly
line of lyr increases and flourishes. ingularly inappropriate persons
are found in itâ€”Mabon, the Galloritish Apollo, as well as Geraint and
others of ing Arthurâ€s court.2

It is so uaint a conceit that Christianity should have been, like
all other things, the gift of the Celtic ades, that it seems almost
a pity to cast doubt on it. he witness of the classical historians
sums up, however, dead in its disfavour. acitus carefully
enumerates the family of Caratacus, and describes how he and his
wife, daughter, and brother were separately interviewed by the
mperor Claudius, but makes no mention at all of the chieftainâ€s
supposed father rn. Moreover, io Cassius gives the name of
Caratacusâ€s father as Cunobelinusâ€”hakespeareâ€s â€Cymbelineâ€â€”who, he
adds, had died before the omans first invaded ritain. he evidence
is wholly against rn as a Christian pioneer. e remains the grim
old god of war and death, â€blessdâ€ only to his pagan votaries, and
especially to the bards, who probably first called him endigeid
ran, and whose stubborn adherence must have been the cause of the
not less stubborn efforts of their enemies, the Christian clerics,
to bring him over to their own side by canonization.

hey had an easier task with rnâ€s sister, ranwen of the â€air osomâ€.
Goddesses, indeed, seem to have stood the process better than
godsâ€”witness â€aintâ€ rigit, the â€Mary of the Gaelâ€. he ritish
Aphrodit became, under the name of rynwyn, or wynwen, a patron saint
of lovers. As late as the fourteenth century, her shrine at landwynwyn,
in Anglesey, was the favourite resort of the disappointed of both sexes,
who came to pray to her image for either success or forgetfulness. o
make the result the more certain, the monks of the church sold ethean
draughts from her sacred well. he legend told of her is that, having
vowed herself to perpetual celibacy, she fell in love with a young chief
called Maelon. ne night, as she was praying for guidance in her
difficulty, she had a vision in which she was offered a goblet of
delicious liuor as a draught of oblivion, and she also saw the same
sweet medicine given to Maelon, whom it at once froze into a block of
ice. he was then, for her faith, offered the granting of three boons.
he first she chose was that Maelon might be allowed to resume his
natural form and temperature the second, that she should no longer
desire to be married and the third, that her intercessions might be
granted for all truehearted lovers, so that they should either wed the
obects of their affection or be cured of their passion. rom this
cause came the virtues of her shrine and fountain. ut the modern
generation no longer flocks there, and the efficacious well is choked
with sand. one the less, she whom the Welsh bards called the â€aint of
oveâ€ still has her occasional votaries. Country girls of the
neighbourhood seek her help when all else fails. he water nearest to
the church is thought to be the best substitute for the now dry and
ruined original well.

A striking contrast to this easy victory over paganism is the stubborn
resistance to Christian adoption of Gwyn son of udd. It is true that he
was once enrolled by some monk in the train of the â€lessd rnâ€,
but it was done in so halfhearted a way that, even now, one can discern
that the writer felt almost ashamed of himself. is fame as at least a
powerful fairy was too vital to be thus tampered with. ven penser,
though, in his aerie ueene, he calls him â€the good ir Guyon ... in
whom great rule of empâ€raunce goodly doth appeareâ€, does not
attempt to conceal his real nature. It is no man, but

                  â€an lfin born, of noble state
              And mickle worship in his native landâ€,

who sets forth the beauties of that virtue for which the original Celtic
paradise, with its unfailing ale and rivers of mead and wine, would
hardly seem to have been the best possible school. ave for penser, all
authorities agree in making Gwyn the determined opponent of things
Christian. A curious and picturesue legend0 is told of him in
connection with t. Collen, who was himself the greatgrandson of rnâ€s
son, Caradawc. he saint, desirous of still further retirement from the
world, had made himself a cell beneath a rock near Glastonbury or, in
Gwynâ€s own â€island of Avilionâ€. It was close to a road, and one day he
heard two men pass by talking about Gwyn son of udd, and declaring him
to be ing of Annwn and the fairies. t. Collen put his head out of the
cell, and told them to hold their tongues, and that Gwyn and his fairies
were only demons. he two men retorted by warning the saint that he
would soon have to meet the dark ruler face to face. hey passed on, and
not long afterwards t. Collen heard someone knocking at his door. n
asking who was there, he got the answer â€I am here, the messenger of
Gwyn ap udd, ing of ades, to bid thee come by the middle of the day
to speak with him on the top of the hill.â€ he saint did not go and the
messenger came a second time with the same message. n the third visit,
he added a threat that, if t. Collen did not come now, it would be the
worse for him. o, a little disuieted, he went, but not unarmed. e
consecrated some water, and took it with him.

n other days the top of Glastonbury or had always been bare, but on
this occasion the saint found it crowned by a splendid castle. Men and
maidens, beautifully dressed, were going in and out. A page received him
and told him that the king was waiting for him to be his guest at
dinner. t. Collen found Gwyn sitting on a golden chair in front of a
table covered with the rarest dainties and wines. e invited him to
share them, adding that if there was anything he especially liked, it
should be brought to him with all honour. â€I do not eat the leaves of
trees,â€ replied the saint, who knew what fairy meats and drinks were
made of. ot taken aback by this discourteous answer, the ing of Annwn
genially asked the saint if he did not admire his servantsâ€ livery,
which was a motley costume, red on one side and blue on the other.
â€heir dress is good enough for its kind,â€ said t. Collen. â€What kind
is thatâ€ asked Gwyn. â€he red shows which side is being scorched, and
the blue shows which side is being frozen,â€ replied the saint, and,
splashing his holy water all round him, he saw castle, servingmen, and
king vanish, leaving him alone on the bare, windy hilltop.

Gwyn, last of the gods of Annwn, has evidently by this time taken over
the functions of all the others. e has the hounds which Arawn once
hadâ€”the Cwn Annwn, â€dogs of hellâ€, with the white bodies and the red
ears. We hear more of them in folklore than we do of their master,
though even their tradition is dying out with the spread of newspapers
and railways. We are not likely to find another everend dmund
ones to insist upon belief in them, lest, by closing our minds to
such manifest witnesses of the supernatural world, we should become
infidels. till, we may even now find peasants ready to swear that they
have heard them sweeping along the hillsides upon stormy nights, as
they pursued the flying souls of unshriven men or unbaptized babes. he
tales told of them agree curiously. heir cry is like that of a pack of
foxhounds, but softer in tone. he nearer they are to a man, the less
loud their voices seem, and the farther off they are, the louder. ut
they are less often seen than heard, and it has been suggested that the
sounds were the cries of migrating beangeese, which are not unlike
those of hounds in chase. he superstition is widely spread. he Cwn
Annwn of Wales are called in orth evon the â€Yethâ€ eath or eathen,
or â€Yellâ€ ounds, and on artmoor, the â€Wishâ€ ounds. In urham and
Yorkshire they are called â€Gabrielâ€ ounds, and they are known by
various names in orfolk, Gloucestershire, and Cornwall. In cotland it
is Arthur who leads the Wild unt, and the tradition is found over
almost the whole of western urope.

ot many folktales have been preserved in which Gwyn is mentioned by
name. is memory has lingered longest and latest in the fairyhaunted
ale of eath, so close to his â€ridge, the aw abode ... not the
nearest aw ... but that aw which is the farthestâ€. ut it may be
understood whenever the king of the fairies is mentioned. As the last of
the greater gods of the old mythology, he has been endowed by popular
fancy with the rule of all the varied fairy population of ritain, so
far, at least, as it is of Celtic or preCeltic origin. or some of the
fairies most famous in nglish literature are eutonic. ing beron
derives his name, through the rench fabliaux, from lberich, the
dwarf king of the iebelungenlied,2 though his ueen, itania, was
probably named out of vidâ€s Metamorphoses. uck, another of
hakespeareâ€s fays, is merely the personification of his race, the
â€pwccasâ€ of Wales, â€pookasâ€ of Ireland, â€poakesâ€ of Worcestershire, and
â€pixiesâ€ of the West of ngland. It is Wales that at the present
time preserves the most numerous and diverse collection of fairies. ome
of them are beautiful, some hideous some kindly, some malevolent. here
are the gentle damsels of the lakes and streams called Gwragedd Annwn,
and the fierce and cruel mountain fairies known as the Gwyllion. here
are the household sprites called wbachod, like the cotch and nglish
â€browniesâ€ the Coblynau, or gnomes of the mines called â€knockersâ€ in
Cornwall and the llyllon, or elves, of whom the pwccas are a
branch. In the orth of ngland the spirits belong more wholly to
the lower type. he bogles, brownies, killmoulis, redcaps, and their
like seem little akin to the higher, Aryanseeming fairies. he Welsh
bwbach, too, is described as brown and hairy, and the coblynau as black
or copperfaced. We shall hardly do wrong in regarding such spectres as
the degraded gods of a preAryan race, like the Irish leprechauns and
pookas, who have nothing in common with the still beautiful, still noble
figures of the uatha  anann.

f these numberless and nameless subects of Gwyn, some dwell beneath
the earth or under the surface of lakesâ€”which seem to take, in Wales,
the place of the Gaelic â€fairy hillsâ€â€”and others in Avilion, a
mysterious western isle of all delights lying on or ust beneath the
sea. embrokeshireâ€”the ancient yfedâ€”has kept the tradition most
completely. he story goes that there is a certain suare yard in the
hundred of Cemmes in that county which holds the secret of the fairy
realm. If a man happens to set his feet on it by chance, his eyes are
opened, and he can see that which is hidden from other menâ€”the fairy
country and commonwealth,â€”but, the moment he moves from the enchanted
spot, he loses the vision, and he can never find the same place
again. hat country is upon the sea, and not far from shore like
the Irish paradise of which it is the counterpart, it may sometimes be
sighted by sailors. he â€Green Meadows of nchantmentâ€ are still an
article of faith among embrokeshire and Caermarthenshire sailors, and
evidently not without some reason. In  a correspondent of the
embroke County Guardian sent in a report made to him by a certain
Captain ohn vans to the effect that, one summer morning, while
trending up the Channel, and passing Gresholm Island the scene of the
entertaining of rnâ€s head, in what he had always known as deep water,
he was surprised to see to windward of him a large tract of land covered
with a beautiful green meadow. It was not, however, above water, but two
or three feet below it, so that the grass waved or swam about as the
ripple floated over it, in a way that made one who watched it feel
drowsy. Captain vans had often heard of the tradition of the fairy
island from old people, but admitted that he had never hoped to see it
with his own eyes. As with the â€ounds of Annwnâ€ one may suspect a
uite natural explanation. Mirage is at once common enough and rare
enough on our coasts to give rise to such a legend, and it must have
been some such phenomenon as the â€ata Morganaâ€ of icily which has made
sober men swear so confidently to ocular evidence of the Celtic
aradise, whether seen from the farthest western coasts of Gaelic
Ireland or cotland, or of ritish Wales.

he fall of the Celtic state worship began earlier in ritain than in
her sister island. either was it Christianity that struck the first
blow, but the rough humanity and stern ustice of the omans. hat
people was more tolerant, perhaps, than any the world has ever known
towards the religions of others, and gladly welcomed the Celtic godsâ€”as
godsâ€”into its own diverse antheon. A friendly Gaulish or ritish
divinity might at any time be granted the sotospeak divine oman
citizenship, and be assimilated to upiter, to Mars, to Apollo, or to
any other properly accredited deity whom the omans deemed him to
resemble. It was not against the god, but against his worship at the
hands of his priests, that oman law struck. he colossal human
sacrifices of the druids horrified even a people who were far from
sueamish about a little bloodshed. hey themselves had abolished such
practices by a decree of the senate before Caesar first invaded
ritain, and could not therefore permit within their empire a cult
which slaughtered men in order to draw omens from their
deathagonies. ruidism was first reuired to be renounced by those
who claimed oman citizenship then it was vigorously put down among the
less civilized tribes. acitus tells us how the Island of Mona
Angleseyâ€”the great stronghold of druidismâ€”was attacked, its sacred
groves cut down, its altars laid level, and its priests put to the
sword.0 liny, recording how the mperor iberius had â€suppressed
the druidsâ€, congratulates his fellowcountrymen on having put an end,
wherever their dominion extended, to the monstrous customs inspired by
the doctrine that the gods could take pleasure in murder and
cannibalism. he practice of druidism, with its attendant
barbarities, abolished in ritain wherever the long oman arm could
reach to strike, took refuge beyond the orthern Wall, among the savage
Caledonian tribes who had not yet submitted to the invaderâ€s yoke.
aturally, too, it remained untouched in Ireland. ut before the omans
left ritain, it had been extirpated everywhere, except among â€the icts
and cotsâ€.

Christianity, following the oman rule, completed the ruin of paganism
in ritain, so far, at least, as its public manifestations were
concerned. In the sixth century of our era, the monkish writer, Gildas,
is able to refer complacently to the ancient ritish religion as a dead
faith. â€I shall notâ€, he says, â€enumerate those diabolical idols of my
country, which almost surpassed in number those of gypt, and of which
we still see some mouldering away within or without the deserted
temples, with stiff and deformed features as was customary. or will I
cry out upon the mountains, fountains, or hills, or upon the rivers,
which now are subservient to the use of men, but once were an
abomination and destruction to them, and to which the blind people paid
divine honour.â€2 And with the idols fell the priests. he very word
â€druidâ€ became obsolete, and is scarcely mentioned in the earliest
ritish literature, though druids are prominent characters in the Irish
writings of the same period.

he secular arm had no power in cotland and in Ireland, conseuently
the battle between aganism and Christianity was fought upon more eual
terms, and lasted longer. In the first country, aint Columba, and in
the second, aint atrick are the personages who, at any rate according
to tradition, beat down the druids and their gods. Adamnan, Abbot of
Iona, who wrote his ita Columb in the last decade of the seventh
century, describes how, a century earlier, that saint had carried the
Gospel to the icts. heir king, rude, received him contemptuously, and
the royal druids left no heathen spell unuttered to thwart and annoy
him. ut, as the power of Moses was greater than the power of the
magicians of gypt, so aint Columbaâ€s prayers caused miracles more
wonderful and more convincing than any wrought by his adversaries. uch
stories belong to the atmosphere of myth which has always enveloped
heroic men the essential fact is that the icts abandoned the old
religion for the new.

A similar legend sums up the lifework of aint atrick in Ireland.
efore he came, Cromm Cruaich had received from time immemorial his
yearly toll of human lives. ut aint atrick faced the gruesome idol
as he raised his crozier, we are told, the demon fell shrieking from his
image, which, deprived of its soul, bowed forward to the ground.

It is far easier, however, to overthrow the more public manifestations
of a creed than to destroy its inner vital force. Cromm Cruaichâ€s idol
might fall, but his spirit would surviveâ€”a very roteus. he sacred
places of the ancient Celtic religion might be invaded, the idols and
altars of the gods thrown down, the priests slain, scattered, or
banished, and the cult officially declared to be extinct but, driven
from the important centres, it would yet survive outside and around
them. he more civilized Gaels and ritons would no doubt accept the
purer gospel, and abandon the gods they had once adored, but the
peasantryâ€”the bulk of the populationâ€”would still cling to the familiar
rites and names. A nobler belief and a higher civilization come, after
all, only as surface waves upon the great ocean of human life beneath
their agitations lies a vast slumbering abyss of halfconscious faith
and thought to which culture penetrates with difficulty and in which
changes come very slowly.

We have already shown how long and how faithfully the Gaelic and Welsh
peasants clung to their old gods, in spite of all the efforts of the
clerics to explain them as ancient kings, to transform them into
wonderworking saints, or to ban them as demons of hell. his
conservative religious instinct of the agricultural populations is not
confined to the inhabitants of the ritish Islands. he modern Greeks
still believe in nereids, in lamias, in sirens, and in Charon, the dark
ferryman of ades. he descendants of the omans and truscans hold
that the old truscan gods and the oman deities of the woods and fields
still live in the world as spirits. he high altars of the â€ord of
the Moundâ€ and his terrible kin were levelled, and their golden images
and great temples left to moulder in abandonment but the rude rustic
shrine to the rude rustic god still received its offerings. It is this
shifting of the care of the pagan cult from chief to peasant, from court
to hovel, and, perhaps, to some extent from higher to lower race, that
serves to explain how the more primitive and uncouth gods have tended so
largely to supplant those of higher, more graceful mien. Aboriginal
deities, thrust into obscurity by the invasion of higher foreign types,
came back to their own again.

or it seems plain that we must divide the spiritual population of the
ritish Islands into two classes. here is little in common between the
â€fairyâ€, strictly socalled, and the unsightly elf who appears under
various names and guises, as pooka, leprechaun, brownie, knocker, or
bogle. he one belongs to such divine tribes as the uatha  anann of
Gaelic myth or their kin, the ritish gods of the Mabinogion. he other
owes his origin to a uite different, and much lower, kind of
imagination. ne might fancy that neolithic man made him in his own
image.

one the less has immemorial tradition wonderfully preserved the
essential features of the Celtic naturegods. he fairy belief of the
present day hardly differs at all from the conception which the Celts
had of their deities. he description of the uatha  anann in the
â€ialogue of the ldersâ€ as â€sprites or fairies with corporeal or
material forms but indued with immortalityâ€ would stand as an account of
prevailing ideas as to the â€good peopleâ€ today. or do the Irish and
Welsh fairies of popular belief differ from one another. oth alike live
among the hills, though in Wales a lake often takes the place of the
â€fairy moundâ€ both, though they war and marry among themselves, are
semiimmortal both covet the children of men, and will steal them from
the cradle, leaving one of their own uncanny brood in the mortal babyâ€s
stead both can lay men and women under spells both delight in music
and the dance, and live lives of unreal and fantastic splendour and
luxury. Another point in which they resemble one another is in their
tiny size. ut this would seem to be the result of the literary
convention originated by hakespeare in genuine folktales, both Gaelic
and ritish, the fairies are pictured as of at least mortal
stature.

ut, Aryan or Iberian, beautiful or hideous, they are fast vanishing
from belief. very year, the secluded valleys in which men and women
might still live in the old way, and dream the old dreams, tend more and
more to be thrown open to the modern world of rapid movement and rapid
thought. he last ten years have perhaps done more in this direction
than the preceding ten generations. What lone shepherd or fisherman will
ever see again the vision of the great Manannn ave the stableboys of
today still any faith left in invarra Is Gwyn ap udd often thought
of in his own valleys of the aw and the edd It would be hard,
perhaps, to find a wholehearted believer even in his local pooka or
parish bogle.

It is the ritual observances of the old Celtic faith which have better
weathered, and will longer survive, the disintegrating influences of
time. here are no hard names to be remembered. hings may still be done
for â€luckâ€ which were once done for religion. Customary observances die
very slowly, held up by an only half acknowledged fear that, unless they
are fulfilled, â€something may happenâ€. We shall get, therefore, more
satisfactory evidence of the nature of the Celtic paganism by examining
such customs than in any other way.

We find three forms of the survival of the ancient religion into uite
recent times. he first is the celebration of the old solar or
agricultural festivals of the spring and autumn euinoxes and of the
summer and winter solstices. he second is the practice of a symbolic
human sacrifice by those who have forgotten its meaning, and only know
that they are keeping up an old custom, oined with late instances of
the actual sacrifices of animals to avert cattleplagues or to change
bad luck. he third consists of many stillliving relics of the once
universal worship of sacred waters, trees, stones, and animals.

Whatever may have been the exact meaning of the Celtic state worship,
there seems to be no doubt that it centred around the four great days in
the year which chronicle the rise, progress, and decline of the sun,
and, therefore, of the fruits of the earth. hese were eltaine, which
fell at the beginning of May Midsummer ay, marking the triumph of
sunshine and vegetation the east of ugh, when, in August, the
turningpoint of the sunâ€s course had been reached and the sad amhain,
when he bade farewell to power, and fell again for half a year under the
sway of the evil forces of winter and darkness.

f these great solar periods, the first and the last were, naturally,
the most important. he whole Celtic mythology seems to revolve upon
them, as upon pivots. It was on the day of eltaine that artholon and
his people, the discoverers, and, indeed, the makers of Ireland, arrived
there from the other world, and it was on the same day, three hundred
years later, that they returned whence they came. It was on eltaineday
that the Gaelic gods, the uatha  anann, and, after them, the Gaelic
men, first set foot on Irish soil. It was on the day of amhain that the
omors oppressed the people of emed with their terrible tax and it was
again at amhain that a later race of gods of light and life finally
conuered those demons at the attle of Moytura. nly one important
mythological incidentâ€”and that was one added at a later timeâ€”happened
upon any other than one of those two days it was upon Midsummer ay,
one of the lesser solar points, that the people of the goddess anu took
Ireland from its inhabitants, the ir olgs.

he mythology of ritain preserves the same rootidea as that of
Ireland. If anything uncanny took place, it was sure to be on Mayday.
It was on â€the night of the first of Mayâ€ that hiannon lost, and
eirnyon wryf liant found, the infant ryderi, as told in the first of
the Mabinogion. It was â€on every Mayeveâ€ that the two dragons
fought and shrieked in the reign of â€ingâ€ ludd. It is on â€every
first of Mayâ€ till the day of doom that Gwyn son of udd, fights with
Gwyrthur son of Greidawl, for luddâ€s fair daughter, Creudylad. And
it was when she was â€amayingâ€ in the woods and fields near Westminster
that the same Gwyn, or Melwas, under his romancename of ir
Meliagraunce, captured Arthurâ€s ueen, Guinevere.

he nature of the rites performed upon these days can be surmised from
their pale survivals. hey are still celebrated by the descendants of
the Celts, though it is probable that few of them knowâ€”or would even
care to knowâ€”why May ay, t. ohnâ€s ay, ammas, and alloweâ€en are
times of ceremony. he firstâ€”called â€eltaineâ€ in Ireland, â€ealtiunnâ€
in cotland, â€henn da oaldynâ€ in the Isle of Man, and â€GalanMaiâ€ the
Calends of May in Walesâ€”celebrates the waking of the earth from her
winter sleep, and the renewal of warmth, life, and vegetation. his is
the meaning of the Maypole, now rarely seen in our streets, though
hakespeare tells us that in his time the festival was so eagerly
anticipated that no one could sleep upon its eve.0 At midnight the
people rose, and, going to the nearest woods, tore down branches of
trees, with which the sun, when he rose, would find doors and windows
decked for him. hey spent the day in dancing round the Maypole, with
rude, rustic mirth, man oining with nature to celebrate the coming of
summer. he opposite to it was the day called â€amhainâ€ in Ireland and
cotland, â€auinâ€ in Man, and â€os Galangaeofâ€ the ight of the Winter
Calends in Wales. his festival was a sad one summer was over, and
winter, with its short, sunless days and long, dreary nights, was at
hand. It was the beginning, too, of the ancient Celtic year, and
omens for the future might be extorted from dark powers by uncanny
rites. It was the holiday of the dead and of all the more evil
supernatural beings. â€n ovembereveâ€, says a orth Cardiganshire
proverb, â€there is a bogy on every stile.â€ he cotch have even invented
a special bogyâ€”the amhanach or goblin which comes out at
amhain.2

he sungod himself is said to have instituted the August festival
called â€ugnassadâ€ ughâ€s commemoration in Ireland, â€la luanysâ€ in
Man, and â€Gwyl Awstâ€ August east in Wales and it was once of hardly
less importance than eltaine or amhain. It is noteworthy, too, that
the first of August was a great day at yonsâ€”formerly called ugudunum,
the dn town of ugus. he midsummer festival, on the other hand,
has largely merged its mythological significance in the Christian east
of t. ohn.

he characteristic features of these festivals give certain proof of
the original nature of the great pagan ceremonials of which they are
the survivals and travesties. In all of them, bonfires are
lighted on the highest hills, and the hearth fires solemnly rekindled.
hey form the excuse for much sport and ollity. ut there is yet
something sinister in the air the â€fairiesâ€ are active and abroad,
and one must be careful to omit no prescribed rite, if one would avoid
kindling their anger or falling into their power. o some of these
stillhalfbelievedin naturegods offerings were made down to a
comparatively late period. When ennant wrote, in the eighteenth
century, it was the custom on eltaineday in many ighland villages
to offer libations and cakes not only to the â€spiritsâ€ who were
believed to be beneficial to the flocks and herds, but also to
creatures like the fox, the eagle, and the hoodiecrow which so often
molested them. At alloweâ€en the Celtic amhain the natives of
the ebrides used to pour libations of ale to a marine god called
hony, imploring him to send seaweed to the shore. In honour,
also, of such beings, curious rites were performed. Maidens washed
their faces in morning dew, with prayers for beauty. hey carried
sprigs of the rowan, that mystic tree whose scarlet berries were the
ambrosial food of the uatha  anann.

In their original form, these now harmless rural holidays were
undoubtedly religious festivals of an orgiastic natureworship such as
became so popular in Greece in connection with the cult of ionysus. he
great â€lords of lifeâ€ and of the powers of nature that made and ruled
life were propitiated by maddening invocations, by riotous dances, and
by human sacrifice.

he bonfires which fill so large a part in the modern festivals have
been casually mentioned. riginally they were no mere feux de oie,
but had a terrible meaning, which the customs connected with them
preserve. At the ighland eltaine, a cake was divided by lot, and
whoever drew the â€burnt pieceâ€ was obliged to leap three times over the
flames. At the midsummer bonfires in Ireland all passed through the
fire the men when the flames were highest, the women when they were
lower, and the cattle when there was nothing left but smoke. In Wales,
upon the last day of ctober, the old amhain, there was a slightly
different, and still more suggestive rite. he hilltop bonfires were
watched until they were announced to be extinct. hen all would race
headlong down the hill, shouting a formula to the effect that the devil
would get the hindmost. he devil of a new belief is the god of the one
it has supplanted in all three instances, the custom was no mere
meaningless horseplay, but a symbolical human sacrifice.

A similar observance, but of a more cruel kind, was kept up in rance
upon t. ohnâ€s ay, until forbidden by law in the reign of ouis the
ourteenth. askets containing living wolves, foxes, and cats were
burned upon the bonfires, under the auspices and in the presence of the
sheriffs or the mayor of the town. Caesar noted the custom among
the druids of constructing huge wickerwork images, which they filled
with living men, and set on fire, and it can hardly be doubted that the
wretched wolves, foxes, and cats were ceremonial substitutes for human
beings.

An ingenious theory was invented, after the introduction of
Christianity, with the purpose of allowing such ancient rites to
continue, with a changed meaning. he passing of persons and cattle
through flame or smoke was explained as a practice which interposed a
magic protection between them and the powers of evil. his homopathic
device of using the evil powerâ€s own sacred fire as a means of
protection against himself somewhat suggests that seething of the kid in
its motherâ€s milk which was reprobated by the evitical law but, no
doubt, pagan â€demonsâ€ were considered fair game. he explanation, of
course, is an obviously and clumsily forced one it was the grim
druidical philosophy thatâ€”to uote Caesarâ€”â€unless the life of man was
repaid for the life of man, the will of the immortal gods could not be
appeasedâ€ that dictated both the national and the private human
sacrifices of the Celts, the shadows of which remain in the leaping
through the bonfires, and in the numerous recorded sacrifices of cattle
within uite recent times.

Mr. aurence Gomme, in his thnology in olklore, has collected many
modern instances of the sacrifices of cattle not only in Ireland and
cotland, but also in Wales, Yorkshire, orthamptonshire, Cornwall, and
the Isle of Man. â€Within twenty miles of the metropolis of cotland
a relative of rofessor impson offered up a live cow as a sacrifice to
the spirit of the murrain.â€ In Wales, when cattlesickness broke
out, a bullock was immolated by being thrown down from the top of a high
rock. Generally, however, the wretched victims were burned alive. In
 an Isle of Man farmer offered a heifer as a burnt offering near
ynwald ill, to avert the anger of the ghostly occupant of a barrow
which had been desecrated by opening. ometimes, even, these burnt
oblations were offered to an alleged Christian saint. he registers of
the resbytery of ingwall for the years  and  contain records
of the sacrifices of cattle upon the site of an ancient temple in honour
of a being whom some called â€t. Mourieâ€, and others, perhaps knowing
his doubtful character, â€ane god Mourieâ€. At irkcudbright, it was
t. Cuthbert, and at Clynnog, in Wales, it was t. euno, who was
thought to delight in the blood of bulls.0

uch sacrifices of cattle appear mainly to have been offered to stay
plague among cattle. Man for man and beast for beast, was, perhaps, the
old rule. ut among all nations, human sacrifices have been gradually
commuted for those of animals. he family of the â€erlebys in
allyvorney, County Cork, used in olden days to keep an idol, â€an image
of wood about two feet high, carved and painted like a womanâ€. he
was the goddess of smallpox, and to her a sheep was immolated on behalf
of anyone seized with that disease.

he third form of Celtic pagan survival is found in numerous instances
of the adoration of water, trees, stones, and animals. ike the other
â€Aryanâ€ nations, the Celts worshipped their rivers. he ee received
divine honours as a wargoddess with the title of Aerfon, while the
ibble, under its name of elisama, was identified by the omans with
Minerva.2 Myths were told of them, as of the sacred streams of
Greece. he ee gave oracles as to the results of the perpetual wars
between the Welsh and the nglish as its stream encroached either upon
the Welsh or the nglish side, so one nation or the other would be
victorious. he weed, like many of the Greek rivers, was credited
with human descendants. hat the rivers of Great ritain received
human sacrifices is clear from the folklore concerning many of them.
eprived of their expected offerings, they are believed to snatch by
stealth the human lives for which they crave. â€iver of art, iver of
art, every year thou claimest a heart,â€ runs the evonshire folksong.
he pey, too, reuires a life yearly, but the pirit of the ibble
is satisfied with one victim at the end of every seven years.

vidence, however, of the worship of rivers is scanty compared with that
of the adoration of wells. â€In the case of wellworship,â€ says Mr.
Gomme, â€it may be asserted with some confidence that it prevails in
every county of the three kingdoms.â€ e finds it most vital in the
Gaelic counties, somewhat less so in the ritish, and almost entirely
wanting in the eutonic southeast. o numerous, indeed, are â€holy
wellsâ€ that several monographs have been written solely upon them.
In some cases these wells were resorted to for the cure of diseases in
others, to obtain change of weather, or â€good luckâ€. fferings were made
to them, to propitiate their guardian gods or nymphs. ennant tells us
that in olden times the rich would sacrifice one of their horses at a
well near Abergeleu, to secure a blessing upon the rest. owls were
offered at t. eglaâ€s Well, near Wrexham, by epileptic patients.0
ut of late years the wellspirits have had to be content with much
smaller tributesâ€”such trifles as pins, rags, coloured pebbles, and small
coins.

With sacred wells were often connected sacred trees, to whose branches
rags and small pieces of garments were suspended by their humble
votaries. ometimes, where the ground near the well was bare of
vegetation, bushes were artificially placed beside the water. he same
people who venerated wells and trees would pay eual adoration to sacred
stones. ord oden, describing, in , the Island of Inniskea, off the
coast of Mayo, asserts that a sacred well called â€errivlaâ€ and a sacred
stone called â€eevougiâ€, which was kept carefully wrapped up in flannel
and brought out at certain periods to be publicly adored, seemed to be
the only deities known to that lone Atlantic islandâ€s three hundred
inhabitants. It sounds incredible but there is ample evidence of
the worship of fetish stones by uite modern inhabitants of our islands.
he Clan Chattan kept such a stone in the Isle of Arran it was
believed, like the stone of Inniskea, to be able to cure diseases, and
was kept carefully â€wrapped up in fair linen cloth, and about that there
was a piece of woollen clothâ€.2 imilarly, too, the worship of wells
was connected with the worship of animals. At a well in the â€evilâ€s
Causewayâ€, between uckley and Acton, in hropshire, lived, and perhaps
still live, four frogs who were, and perhaps still are, believed to be
â€the devil and his impsâ€â€”that is to say, gods or demons of a proscribed
idolatry. In Ireland such guardian spirits are usually fishâ€”trout,
eels, or salmon thought to be endowed with eternal life. he genius
of a well in anffshire took the form of a fly, which was also said to
be undying, but to transmigrate from body to body. Its function was to
deliver oracles according as it seemed active or lethargic, its
votaries drew their omens. It is needless to multiply instances of
a still surviving cult of water, trees, stones, and animals. nough to
say that it would be easy. What concerns us is that we are face to face
in ritain with living forms of the oldest, lowest, most primitive
religion in the worldâ€”one which would seem to have been once universal,
and which, crouching close to the earth, lets other creeds blow over it
without effacing it, and outlives one and all of them.

It underlies the three great worldreligions, and still forms the real
belief of perhaps the maority of their titular adherents. It is
characteristic of the wisdom of the Christian Church that, knowing its
power, she sought rather to sanctify than to extirpate it. What once
were the Celtic euivalents of the Greek â€fountains of the nymphsâ€ were
consecrated as â€holy wellsâ€. he process of so adopting them began
early. t. Columba, when he went in the sixth century to convert the
icts, found a spring which they worshipped as a god he blessed it, and
â€from that day the demon separated from the waterâ€. Indeed, he so
sanctified no less than three hundred such springs. acred stones
were eually taken under the gis of Christianity. ome were placed on
the altars of cathedrals, others built into consecrated walls. he
animal gods either found themselves the heroes of Christian legends, or
where, for some reason, such adoption was hopeless, were proclaimed
â€witchesâ€ animalsâ€, and dealt with accordingly. uch happened to the
hare, a creature sacred to the ancient ritons, but now in bad
odour among the superstitious. he wren, too, is hunted to death upon
t. tephenâ€s ay in Ireland. Its crime is said to be that it has â€a
drop of the deâ€ilâ€s blood in itâ€, but the real reason is probably to be
found in the fact that the Irish druids used to draw auguries from its
chirpings.

                                              

We have made in this volume some attempt to draw a picture of the
ancient religion of our earliest ancestors, the Gaelic and the ritish
Celts. We have shown what can be gathered of the broken remnants of a
mythology as splendid in conception and as brilliant in colour as that
of the Greeks. We have tried to paint its divine figures, and to retell
their heroic stories. We have seen them fall from their shrines, and
yet, rising again, take on new lives as kings, or saints, or knights of
romance, and we have caught fading glimpses of them surviving today as
the â€fairiesâ€, their rites still cherished by worshippers who hardly
know who or why they worship. f necessity this survey has been brief
and incomplete. Whether the great edifice of the Celtic mythology will
ever be wholly restored one can at present only speculate. Its colossal
fragments are perhaps too deeply buried and too widely scattered. ut,
even as it stands ruined, it is a mighty uarry from which poets yet
unborn will hew spiritual marble for houses not made with hands.

he obect of this short list is merely to supplement the marginal notes
by pointing out to a reader desirous of going deeper into the subect
