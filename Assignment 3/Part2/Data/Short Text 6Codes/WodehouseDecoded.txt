heres a divinity that shapes our ends. Consider the case of enry
ifield ice, detective.

I must explain enry early, to avoid disappointment. If I simply said
he was a detective, and let it go at that, I should be obtaining the
readers interest under false pretences. e was really only a sort of
detective, a species of sleuth. At taffords International
Investigation ureau, in the trand, where he was employed, they did
not reuire him to solve mysteries which had baffled the police. e had
never measured a footprint in his life, and what he did not know about
bloodstains would have filled a library. he sort of ob they gave
enry was to stand outside a restaurant in the rain, and note what time
someone inside left it. In short, it is not ifield ice,
Investigator. o. .he Adventure of the Maharaahs uby that I
submit to your notice, but the unsensational doings of a uite
commonplace young man, variously known to his comrades at the ureau as
athead, hat blighter whatshisname, and ere, you

enry lived in a boardinghouse in Guildford treet. ne day a new girl
came to the boardinghouse, and sat next to enry at meals. er name
was Alice Weston. he was small and uiet, and rather pretty. hey got
on splendidly. heir conversation, at first confined to the weather and
the movingpictures, rapidly became more intimate. enry was surprised
to find that she was on the stage, in the chorus. revious chorusgirls
at the boardinghouse had been of a more pronounced typegood girls,
but noisy, and apt to wear beautyspots. Alice Weston was different.

Im rehearsing at present, she said. Im going out on tour next
month in he Girl rom righton. What do you do, Mr ice

enry paused for a moment before replying. e knew how sensational he
was going to be.

Im a detective.

sually, when he told girls his profession, sueaks of amazed
admiration greeted him. ow he was chagrined to perceive in the brown
eyes that met his distinct disapproval.

Whats the matter he said, a little anxiously, for even at this
early stage in their acuaintance he was conscious of a strong desire
to win her approval. ont you like detectives

I dont know. omehow I shouldnt have thought you were one.

his restored enrys euanimity somewhat. aturally a detective does
not want to look like a detective and give the whole thing away right
at the start.

I thinkyou wont be offended

Go on.

Ive always looked on it as rather a sneaky ob.

neaky moaned enry.

Well, creeping about, spying on people.

enry was appalled. he had defined his own trade to a nicety. here
might be detectives whose work was above this reproach, but he was a
confirmed creeper, and he knew it. It wasnt his fault. he boss told
him to creep, and he crept. If he declined to creep, he would be sacked
instanter. It was hard, and yet he felt the sting of her words,
and in his bosom the first seeds of dissatisfaction with his occupation
took root.

You might have thought that this frankness on the girls part would
have kept enry from falling in love with her. Certainly the dignified
thing would have been to change his seat at table, and take his meals
next to someone who appreciated the romance of detective work a little
more. ut no, he remained where he was, and presently Cupid, who never
shoots with a surer aim than through the steam of boardinghouse hash,
sniped him where he sat.

e proposed to Alice Weston. he refused him.

Its not because Im not fond of you. I think youre the nicest man I
ever met. A good deal of assiduous attention had enabled enry to win
this place in her affections. e had worked patiently and well before
actually putting his fortune to the test. Id marry you tomorrow if
things were different. ut Im on the stage, and I mean to stick there.
Most of the girls want to get off it, but not me. And one thing Ill
never do is marry someone who isnt in the profession. My sister
Genevieve did, and look what happened to her. he married a commercial
traveller, and take it from me he travelled. he never saw him for more
than five minutes in the year, except when he was selling gents
hosiery in the same town where she was doing her refined speciality,
and then hed ust wave his hand and whiz by, and start travelling
again. My husband has got to be close by, where I can see him. Im
sorry, enry, but I know Im right.

It seemed final, but enry did not wholly despair. e was a resolute
young man. You have to be to wait outside restaurants in the rain for
any length of time.

e had an inspiration. e sought out a dramatic agent.

I want to go on the stage, in musical comedy.

ets see you dance.

I cant dance.

ing, said the agent. top singing, added the agent, hastily.

You go away and have a nice cup of hot tea, said the agent,
soothingly, and youll be as right as anything in the morning.

enry went away.

A few days later, at the ureau, his fellowdetective immonds hailed
him.

ere, you he boss wants you. uck up

Mr tafford was talking into the telephone. e replaced the receiver as
enry entered.

h, ice, heres a woman wants her husband shadowed while hes on the
road. es an actor. Im sending you. Go to this address, and get
photographs and all particulars. Youll have to catch the eleven
oclock train on riday.

Yes, sir.

es in he Girl rom righton company. hey open at ristol.

It sometimes seemed to enry as if ate did it on purpose. If the
commission had had to do with any other company, it would have been
well enough, for, professionally speaking, it was the most important
with which he had ever been entrusted. If he had never met Alice
Weston, and heard her views upon detective work, he would have been
pleased and flattered. hings being as they were, it was enrys
considered opinion that ate had slipped one over on him.

In the first place, what torture to be always near her, unable to
reveal himself to watch her while she disported herself in the company
of other men. e would be disguised, and she would not recognize him
but he would recognize her, and his sufferings would be dreadful.

In the second place, to have to do his creeping about and spying
practically in her presence

till, business was business.

At five minutes to eleven on the morning named he was at the station, a
false beard and spectacles shielding his identity from the public eye.
If you had asked him he would have said that he was a cotch business
man. As a matter of fact, he looked far more like a motorcar coming
through a haystack.

he platform was crowded. riends of the company had come to see the
company off. enry looked on discreetly from behind a stout porter,
whose bulk formed a capital screen. In spite of himself, he was
impressed. he stage at close uarters always thrilled him. e
recognized celebrities. he fat man in the brown suit was Walter
elliffe, the comedian and star of the company. e stared keenly at him
through the spectacles. thers of the famous were scattered about. e
saw Alice. he was talking to a man with a face like a hatchet, and
smiling, too, as if she enoyed it. ehind the matted foliage which he
had inflicted on his face, enrys teeth came together with a snap.

In the weeks that followed, as he dogged he Girl rom righton
company from town to town, it would be difficult to say whether enry
was happy or unhappy. n the one hand, to realize that Alice was so
near and yet so inaccessible was a constant source of misery yet, on
the other, he could not but admit that he was having the very dickens
of a time, loafing round the country like this.

e was made for this sort of life, he considered. ate had placed him
in a ondon office, but what he really enoyed was this unfettered
travel. ome gipsy strain in him rendered even the obvious discomforts
of theatrical touring agreeable. e liked catching trains he liked
invading strange hotels above all, he revelled in the artistic
pleasure of watching unsuspecting fellowmen as if they were so many
ants.

hat was really the best part of the whole thing. It was all very well
for Alice to talk about creeping and spying, but, if you considered it
without bias, there was nothing degrading about it at all. It was an
art. It took brains and a genius for disguise to make a man a
successful creeper and spyer. You couldnt simply say to yourself, I
will creep. If you attempted to do it in your own person, you would be
detected instantly. You had to be an adept at masking your personality.
You had to be one man at ristol and another uite different man at
ullespecially if, like enry, you were of a gregarious disposition,
and liked the society of actors.

he stage had always fascinated enry. o meet even minor members of
the profession off the boards gave him a thrill. here was a resting
uvenile, of fitup calibre, at his boardinghouse who could always get
a shilling out of him simply by talking about how he had umped in and
saved the show at the hamlets which he had visited in the course of his
wanderings. And on this Girl rom righton tour he was in constant
touch with men who really amounted to something. Walter elliffe had
been a celebrity when enry was going to school and idney Crane, the
baritone, and others of the lengthy cast, were all players not unknown
in ondon. enry courted them assiduously.

It had not been hard to scrape acuaintance with them. he principals
of the company always put up at the best hotel, andhis expenses being
paid by his employerso did enry. It was the easiest thing possible
to bridge with a welltimed whiskyandsoda the gulf between
nonacuaintance and warm friendship. Walter elliffe, in particular,
was peculiarly accessible. very time enry accosted himas a
different individual, of courseand renewed in a fresh disguise the
friendship which he had enoyed at the last town, Walter elliffe met
him more than halfway.

It was in the sixth week of the tour that the comedian, promoting him
from mere casual acuaintanceship, invited him to come up to his room
and smoke a cigar.

enry was pleased and flattered. elliffe was a personage, always
surrounded by admirers, and the compliment was conseuently of a high
order.

e lit his cigar. Among his friends at the Greenoom Club it was
unanimously held that Walter elliffes cigars brought him within the
scope of the law forbidding the carrying of concealed weapons but
enry would have smoked the gift of such a man if it had been a
cabbageleaf. e puffed away contentedly. e was made up as an old
Indian colonel that week, and he complimented his host on the aroma
with a fine oldworld courtesy.

Walter elliffe seemed gratified.

uite comfortable he asked.

uite, I thank you, said enry, fondling his silver moustache.

hats right. And now tell me, old man, which of us is it youre
trailing

enry nearly swallowed his cigar.

What do you mean

h, come, protested elliffe theres no need to keep it up with me.
I know youre a detective. he uestion is, Whos the man youre after
hats what weve all been wondering all this time.

All hey had all been wondering It was worse than enry could have
imagined. ill now he had pictured his position with regard to he
Girl rom righton company rather as that of some scientist who,
seeing but unseen, keeps a watchful eye on the denizens of a drop of
water under his microscope. And they had all detected himevery one of
them.

It was a stunning blow. If there was one thing on which enry prided
himself it was the impenetrability of his disguises. e might be slow
he might be on the stupid side but he could disguise himself. e had a
variety of disguises, each designed to befog the public more hopelessly
than the last.

Going down the street, you would meet a typical commercial traveller,
dapper and alert. Anon, you encountered a heavily bearded Australian.
ater, maybe, it was a courteous old retired colonel who stopped you
and inuired the way to rafalgar uare. till later, a rather flashy
individual of the sporting type asked you for a match for his cigar.
Would you have suspected for one instant that each of these widely
differing personalities was in reality one man

Certainly you would.

enry did not know it, but he had achieved in the eyes of the small
servant who answered the frontdoor bell at his boardinghouse a
wellestablished reputation as a humorist of the more practical kind.
It was his habit to try his disguises on her. e would ring the bell,
inuire for the landlady, and when ella had gone, leap up the stairs
to his room. ere he would remove the disguise, resume his normal
appearance, and come downstairs again, humming a careless air. ella,
meanwhile, in the kitchen, would be confiding to her ally the cook that
Mr ice had est come in, lookin sort o funny again.

e sat and gaped at Walter elliffe. he comedian regarded him
curiously.

You look at least a hundred years old, he said. What are you made up
as A piece of Gorgonzola

enry glanced hastily at the mirror. Yes, he did look rather old. e
must have overdone some of the lines on his forehead. e looked
something between a youngish centenarian and a nonagenarian who had
seen a good deal of trouble.

If you knew how you were demoralizing the company, elliffe went on,
you would drop it. As steady and uiet a lot of boys as ever you met
till you came along. ow they do nothing but bet on what disguise
youre going to choose for the next town. I dont see why you need to
change so often. You were all right as the cotchman at ristol. We
were all saying how nice you looked. You should have stuck to that. ut
what do you do at ull but roll in in a scrubby moustache and a tweed
suit, looking rotten. owever, all that is beside the point. Its a
free country. If you like to spoil your beauty, I suppose theres no
law against it. What I want to know is, whos the man Whose track are
you sniffing on, ill Youll pardon my calling you ill. Youre known
as ill the loodhound in the company. Whos the man

ever mind, said enry.

e was aware, as he made it, that it was not a very able retort, but he
was feeling too limp for satisfactory repartee. Criticisms in the
ureau, dealing with his alleged solidity of skull, he did not resent.
e attributed them to mans natural desire to chaff his fellowman. ut
to be unmasked by the general public in this way was another matter. It
struck at the root of all things.

ut I do mind, obected elliffe. Its most important. A lot of
money hangs on it. Weve got a sweepstake on in the company, the holder
of the winning name to take the entire receipts. Come on. Who is he

enry rose and made for the door. is feelings were too deep for words.
ven a minor detective has his professional pride and the knowledge
that his espionage is being made the basis of sweepstakes by his uarry
cuts this to the uick.

ere, dont go Where are you going

ack to ondon, said enry, bitterly. Its a lot of good my staying
here now, isnt it

I should say it wasto me. ont be in a hurry. Youre thinking that,
now we know all about you, your utility as a sleuth has waned to some
extent. Is that it

Well

Well, why worry What does it matter to you You dont get paid by
results, do you Your boss said rail along. Well, do it, then. I
should hate to lose you. I dont suppose you know it, but youve been
the best mascot this tour that Ive ever come across. ight from the
start weve been playing to enormous business. Id rather kill a black
cat than lose you. rop the disguises, and stay with us. Come behind
all you want, and be sociable.

A detective is only human. he less of a detective, the more human he
is. enry was not much of a detective, and his human traits were
conseuently highly developed. rom a boy, he had never been able to
resist curiosity. If a crowd collected in the street he always added
himself to it, and he would have stopped to gape at a window with
Watch this window written on it, if he had been running for his life
from wild bulls. e was, and always had been, intensely desirous of
some day penetrating behind the scenes of a theatre.

And there was another thing. At last, if he accepted this invitation,
he would be able to see and speak to Alice Weston, and interfere with
the manoeuvres of the hatchetfaced man, on whom he had brooded with
suspicion and ealousy since that first morning at the station. o see
Alice erhaps, with elouence, to talk her out of that ridiculous
resolve of hers

Why, theres something in that, he said.

ather Well, thats settled. And now, touching that sweep, who
is it

I cant tell you that. You see, so far as that goes, Im ust where I
was before. I can still watchwhoever it is Im watching.

ash it, so you can. I didnt think of that, said elliffe, who
possessed a sensitive conscience. urely between ourselves, it isnt
me, is it

enry eyed him inscrutably. e could look inscrutable at times.

Ah he said, and left uickly, with the feeling that, however poorly
he had shown up during the actual interview, his exit had been good. e
might have been a failure in the matter of disguise, but nobody could
have put more uiet sinisterness into that Ah It did much to soothe
him and ensure a peaceful nights rest.

n the following night, for the first time in his life, enry found
himself behind the scenes of a theatre, and instantly began to
experience all the complex emotions which come to the layman in that
situation. hat is to say, he felt like a cat which has strayed into a
strange hostile backyard. e was in a new world, inhabited by weird
creatures, who flitted about in an eerie semidarkness, like brightly
coloured animals in a cavern.

he Girl rom righton was one of those exotic productions specially
designed for the ired usiness Man. It relied for a large measure of
its success on the size and appearance of its chorus, and on their
constant change of costume. enry, as a conseuence, was the centre of
a kaleidoscopic whirl of feminine loveliness, dressed to represent
such varying flora and fauna as rabbits, arisian students, colleens,
utch peasants, and daffodils. Musical comedy is the Irish stew of the
drama. Anything may be put into it, with the certainty that it will
improve the general effect.

e scanned the throng for a sight of Alice. ften as he had seen the
piece in the course of its six weeks wandering in the wilderness he
had never succeeded in recognizing her from the front of the house.
uite possibly, he thought, she might be on the stage already, hidden
in a rosetree or some other shrub, ready at the signal to burst forth
upon the audience in short skirts for in he Girl rom righton
almost anything could turn suddenly into a chorusgirl.

hen he saw her, among the daffodils. he was not a particularly
convincing daffodil, but she looked good to enry. With wabbling knees
he butted his way through the crowd and seized her hand
enthusiastically.

Why, enry Where did you come from

I am glad to see you

ow did you get here

I am glad to see you

At this point the stagemanager, bellowing from the promptbox, urged
enry to desist. It is one of the mysteries of behindthescenes
acoustics that a whisper from any minor member of the company can be
heard all over the house, while the stagemanager can burst himself
without annoying the audience.

enry, awed by authority, relapsed into silence. rom the unseen stage
came the sound of someone singing a song about the moon. une was also
mentioned. e recognized the song as one that had always bored him. e
disliked the woman who was singing ita Miss Clarice Weaver, who
played the heroine of the piece to idney Cranes hero.

In his opinion he was not alone. Miss Weaver was not popular in the
company. he had secured the role rather as a testimony of personal
esteem from the management than because of any innate ability. he sang
badly, acted indifferently, and was uncertain what to do with her
hands. All these things might have been forgiven her, but she
supplemented them by the crime known in stage circles as throwing her
weight about. hat is to say, she was hard to please, and, when not
pleased, apt to say so in no uncertain voice. o his personal friends
Walter elliffe had freuently confided that, though not a rich man, he
was in the market with a substantial reward for anyone who was man
enough to drop a ton of iron on Miss Weaver.

onight the song annoyed enry more than usual, for he knew that very
soon the daffodils were due on the stage to clinch the verisimilitude
of the scene by dancing the tango with the rabbits. e endeavoured to
make the most of the time at his disposal.

I am glad to see you he said.

hh said the stagemanager.

enry was discouraged. omeo could not have made love under these
conditions. And then, ust when he was pulling himself together to
begin again, she was torn from him by the exigencies of the play.

e wandered moodily off into the dusty semidarkness. e avoided the
promptbox, whence he could have caught a glimpse of her, being loath
to meet the stagemanager ust at present.

Walter elliffe came up to him, as he sat on a box and brooded on life.

A little less of the double forte, old man, he said. Miss Weaver has
been kicking about the noise on the side. he wanted you thrown out,
but I said you were my mascot, and I would die sooner than part with
you. ut I should go easy on the chestnotes, I think, all the same.

enry nodded moodily. e was depressed. e had the feeling, which comes
so easily to the intruder behind the scenes, that nobody loved him.

he piece proceeded. rom the front of the house roars of laughter
indicated the presence on the stage of Walter elliffe, while now and
then a lethargic silence suggested that Miss Clarice Weaver was in
action. rom time to time the empty space about him filled with girls
dressed in accordance with the exuberant fancy of the producer of the
piece. When this happened, enry would leap from his seat and endeavour
to locate Alice but always, ust as he thought he had done so, the
hidden orchestra would burst into melody and the chorus would be called
to the front.

It was not till late in the second act that he found an opportunity for
further speech.

he plot of he Girl rom righton had by then reached a critical
stage. he situation was as follows he hero, having been disinherited
by his wealthy and titled father for falling in love with the heroine,
a poor shopgirl, has disguised himself by wearing a different
coloured necktie and has come in pursuit of her to a wellknown
seaside resort, where, having disguised herself by changing her dress,
she is serving as a waitress in the otunda, on the splanade. he
family butler, disguised as a athchair man, has followed the hero,
and the wealthy and titled father, disguised as an Italian
operasinger, has come to the place for a reason which, though
extremely sound, for the moment eludes the memory. Anyhow, he is there,
and they all meet on the splanade. ach recognizes the other, but
thinks he himself is unrecognized. xeunt all, hurriedly,
leaving the heroine alone on the stage.

It is a crisis in the heroines life. he meets it bravely. he sings a
song entitled My onolulu ueen, with chorus of apanese girls and
ulgarian officers.

Alice was one of the apanese girls.

he was standing a little apart from the other apanese girls. enry
was on her with a bound. ow was his time. e felt keyed up, full of
persuasive words. In the interval which had elapsed since their last
conversation yeasty emotions had been playing the dickens with his
selfcontrol. It is practically impossible for a novice, suddenly
introduced behind the scenes of a musical comedy, not to fall in love
with somebody and, if he is already in love, his fervour is increased
to a dangerous point.

enry felt that it was now or never. e forgot that it was perfectly
possibleindeed, the reasonable courseto wait till the performance
was over, and renew his appeal to Alice to marry him on the way back to
her hotel. e had the feeling that he had got ust about a uarter of a
minute. uick action hat was enrys slogan.

e seized her hand.

Alice

hh hissed the stagemanager.

isten I love you. Im crazy about you. What does it matter whether
Im on the stage or not I love you.

top that row there

Wont you marry me

he looked at him. It seemed to him that she hesitated.

Cut it out bellowed the stagemanager, and enry cut it out.

And at this moment, when his whole fate hung in the balance, there came
from the stage that devastating high note which is the sign that the
solo is over and that the chorus are now about to mobilize. As if drawn
by some magnetic power, she suddenly receded from him, and went on to
the stage.

A man in enrys position and frame of mind is not responsible for his
actions. e saw nothing but her he was blind to the fact that
important manoeuvres were in progress. All he understood was that she
was going from him, and that he must stop her and get this thing
settled.

e clutched at her. he was out of range, and getting farther away
every instant.

e sprang forward.

he advice that should be given to every young man starting life isif
you happen to be behind the scenes at a theatre, never spring forward.
he whole architecture of the place is designed to undo those who so
spring. ours before, the stagecarpenters have laid their traps, and
in the semidarkness you cannot but fall into them.

he trap into which enry fell was a raised board. It was not a very
highlyraised board. It was not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
churchdoor, but twas enoughit served. tubbing it suarely with his
toe, enry shot forward, all arms and legs.

It is the instinct of Man, in such a situation, to grab at the nearest
support. enry grabbed at the otel uperba, the pride of the
splanade. It was a thin wooden edifice, and it supported him for
perhaps a tenth of a second. hen he staggered with it into the
limelight, tripped over a ulgarian officer who was inflating himself
for a deep note, and finally fell in a complicated heap as exactly in
the centre of the stage as if he had been a star of years standing.

It went well there was no uestion of that. revious audiences had
always been rather cold towards this particular song, but this one got
on its feet and yelled for more. rom all over the house came rapturous
demands that enry should go back and do it again.

ut enry was giving no encores. e rose to his feet, a little stunned,
and automatically began to dust his clothes. he orchestra, unnerved by
this unrehearsed infusion of new business, had stopped playing.
ulgarian officers and apanese girls alike seemed uneual to the
situation. hey stood about, waiting for the next thing to break loose.
rom somewhere far away came faintly the voice of the stagemanager
inventing new words, new combinations of words, and new throat noises.

And then enry, massaging a stricken elbow, was aware of Miss Weaver at
his side. ooking up, he caught Miss Weavers eye.

A familiar stagedirection of melodrama reads, xit cautious through
gap in hedge. It was enrys first appearance on any stage, but he did
it like a veteran.

My dear fellow, said Walter elliffe. he hour was midnight, and he
was sitting in enrys bedroom at the hotel. eaving the theatre, enry
had gone to bed almost instinctively. ed seemed the only haven for
him. My dear fellow, dont apologize. You have put me under lasting
obligations. In the first place, with your unerring sense of the stage,
you saw ust the spot where the piece needed livening up, and you
livened it up. hat was good but far better was it that you also sent
our Miss Weaver into violent hysterics, from which she emerged to hand
in her notice. he leaves us tomorrow.

enry was appalled at the extent of the disaster for which he was
responsible.

What will you do

o Why, its what we have all been praying fora miracle which
should eect Miss Weaver. It needed a genius like you to come to bring
it off. idney Cranes wife can play the part without rehearsal. he
understudied it all last season in ondon. Crane has ust been speaking
to her on the phone, and she is catching the night express.

enry sat up in bed.

What

Whats the trouble now

idney Cranes wife

What about her

A bleakness fell upon enrys soul.

he was the woman who was employing me. ow I shall be taken off the
ob and have to go back to ondon.

You dont mean that it was really Cranes wife

elliffe was regarding him with a kind of awe.

addie, he said, in a hushed voice, you almost scare me. here seems
to be no limit to your powers as a mascot. You fill the house every
night, you get rid of the Weaver woman, and now you tell me this. I
drew Crane in the sweep, and I would have taken twopence for my chance
of winning it.

I shall get a telegram from my boss tomorrow recalling me.

ont go. tick with me. oin the troupe.

enry stared.

What do you mean I cant sing or act.

elliffes voice thrilled with earnestness.

My boy, I can go down the trand and pick up a hundred fellows who can
sing and act. I dont want them. I turn them away. ut a seventh son of
a seventh son like you, a human horseshoe like you, a king of mascots
like youthey dont make them nowadays. heyve lost the pattern. If
you like to come with me Ill give you a contract for any number of
years you suggest. I need you in my business. e rose. hink it over,
laddie, and let me know tomorrow. ook here upon this picture, and on
that. As a sleuth you are poor. You couldnt detect a bassdrum in a
telephonebooth. You have no future. You are merely among those
present. ut as a mascotmy boy, youre the only thing in sight. You
cant help succeeding on the stage. You dont have to know how to act.
ook at the dozens of good actors who are out of obs. Why nlucky. o
other reason. With your luck and a little experience youll be a star
before you know youve begun. hink it over, and let me know in the
morning.

efore enrys eyes there rose a sudden vision of Alice Alice no
longer unattainable Alice walking on his arm down the aisle Alice
mending his socks Alice with her heavenly hands fingering his salary
envelope.

ont go, he said. ont go. Ill let you know now.

                                   

he scene is the trand, hard by edford treet the time, that restful
hour of the afternoon when they of the gnarled faces and the bright
clothing gather together in groups to tell each other how good they

ICAIG YG GI


he sprang it on me before breakfast. here in seven words you have a
complete character sketch of my Aunt Agatha. I could go on indefinitely
about brutality and lack of consideration. I merely say that she routed
me out of bed to listen to her painful story somewhere in the small
hours. It cant have been half past eleven when eeves, my man, woke me
out of the dreamless and broke the news

Mrs Gregson to see you, sir.

I thought she must be walking in her sleep, but I crawled out of bed
and got into a dressinggown. I knew Aunt Agatha well enough to know
that, if she had come to see me, she was going to see me. hats the
sort of woman she is.

he was sitting bolt upright in a chair, staring into space. When I
came in she looked at me in that darn critical way that always makes me
feel as if I had gelatine where my spine ought to be. Aunt Agatha is
one of those strongminded women. I should think ueen lizabeth must
have been something like her. he bosses her husband, pencer Gregson,
a battered little chappie on the tock xchange. he bosses my cousin,
Gussie Manneringhipps. he bosses her sisterinlaw, Gussies mother.
And, worst of all, she bosses me. he has an eye like a maneating
fish, and she has got moral suasion down to a fine point.

I dare say there are fellows in the worldmen of blood and iron, dont
you know, and all that sort of thingwhom she couldnt intimidate but
if youre a chappie like me, fond of a uiet life, you simply curl into
a ball when you see her coming, and hope for the best. My experience is
that when Aunt Agatha wants you to do a thing you do it, or else you
find yourself wondering why those fellows in the olden days made such a
fuss when they had trouble with the panish Inuisition.

alloa, Aunt Agatha I said

ertie, she said, you look a sight. You look perfectly dissipated.

I was feeling like a badly wrapped brownpaper parcel. Im never at my
best in the early morning. I said so.

arly morning I had breakfast three hours ago, and have been walking
in the park ever since, trying to compose my thoughts.

If I ever breakfasted at half past eight I should walk on the
mbankment, trying to end it all in a watery grave.

I am extremely worried, ertie. hat is why I have come to you.

And then I saw she was going to start something, and I bleated weakly
to eeves to bring me tea. ut she had begun before I could get it.

What are your immediate plans, ertie

Well, I rather thought of tottering out for a bite of lunch later on,
and then possibly staggering round to the club, and after that, if I
felt strong enough, I might trickle off to Walton eath for a round of
golf.

I am not interested in your totterings and tricklings. I mean, have you
any important engagements in the next week or so

I scented danger.

ather, I said. eaps Millions ooked solid

What are they

Ierwell, I dont uite know.

I thought as much. You have no engagements. ery well, then, I want
you to start immediately for America.

America

o not lose sight of the fact that all this was taking place on an
empty stomach, shortly after the rising of the lark.

Yes, America. I suppose even you have heard of America

ut why America

ecause that is where your Cousin Gussie is. e is in ew York, and I
cant get at him.

Whats Gussie been doing

Gussie is making a perfect idiot of himself.

o one who knew young Gussie as well as I did, the words opened up a
wide field for speculation.

In what way

e has lost his head over a creature.

n past performances this rang true. ver since he arrived at mans
estate Gussie had been losing his head over creatures. es that sort
of chap. ut, as the creatures never seemed to lose their heads over
him, it had never amounted to much.

I imagine you know perfectly well why Gussie went to America, ertie.
You know how wickedly extravagant your ncle Cuthbert was.

he alluded to Gussies governor, the late head of the family, and I am
bound to say she spoke the truth. obody was fonder of old ncle
Cuthbert than I was, but everybody knows that, where money was
concerned, he was the most complete chump in the annals of the nation.
e had an expensive thirst. e never backed a horse that didnt get
housemaids knee in the middle of the race. e had a system of beating
the bank at Monte Carlo which used to make the administration hang out
the bunting and ring the oybells when he was sighted in the offing.
ake him for all in all, dear old ncle Cuthbert was as willing a
spender as ever called the family lawyer a bloodsucking vampire because
he wouldnt let ncle Cuthbert cut down the timber to raise another
thousand.

e left your Aunt ulia very little money for a woman in her
position. eechwood reuires a great deal of keeping up, and
poor dear pencer, though he does his best to help, has not
unlimited resources. It was clearly understood why Gussie went
to America. e is not clever, but he is very goodlooking, and,
though he has no title, the Manneringhippses are one of the best
and oldest families in ngland. e had some excellent letters of
introduction, and when he wrote home to say that he had met the
most charming and beautiful girl in the world I felt uite happy.
e continued to rave about her for several mails, and then this
morning a letter has come from him in which he says, uite casually
as a sort of afterthought, that he knows we are broadminded enough
not to think any the worse of her because she is on the vaudeville
stage.

h, I say

It was like a thunderbolt. he girls name, it seems, is ay enison,
and according to Gussie she does something which he describes as a
single on the big time. What this degraded performance may be I have
not the least notion. As a further recommendation he states that she
lifted them out of their seats at Mosensteins last week. Who she may
be, and how or why, and who or what Mr Mosenstein may be, I cannot tell
you.

y ove, I said, its like a sort of thingummybob, isnt it A sort
of fate, what

I fail to understand you.

Well, Aunt ulia, you know, dont you know eredity, and so forth.
Whats bred in the bone will come out in the wash, and all that kind of
thing, you know.

ont be absurd, ertie.

hat was all very well, but it was a coincidence for all that. obody
ever mentions it, and the family have been trying to forget it for
twentyfive years, but its a known fact that my Aunt ulia, Gussies
mother, was a vaudeville artist once, and a very good one, too, Im
told. he was playing in pantomime at rury ane when ncle Cuthbert
saw her first. It was before my time, of course, and long before I was
old enough to take notice the family had made the best of it, and Aunt
Agatha had pulled up her socks and put in a lot of educative work, and
with a microscope you couldnt tell Aunt ulia from a genuine
dyedinthewool aristocrat. Women adapt themselves so uickly

I have a pal who married aisy rimble of the Gaiety, and when I meet
her now I feel like walking out of her presence backwards. ut there
the thing was, and you couldnt get away from it. Gussie had vaudeville
blood in him, and it looked as if he were reverting to type, or
whatever they call it.

y ove, I said, for I am interested in this heredity stuff, perhaps
the thing is going to be a regular family tradition, like you read
about in booksa sort of Curse of the Manneringhippses, as it were.
erhaps each head of the familys going to marry into vaudeville for
ever and ever. nto the whatdyoucallit generation, dont you know

lease do not be uite idiotic, ertie. here is one head of the
family who is certainly not going to do it, and that is Gussie. And you
are going to America to stop him.

Yes, but why me

Why you You are too vexing, ertie. ave you no sort of feeling for
the family You are too lazy to try to be a credit to yourself, but at
least you can exert yourself to prevent Gussies disgracing us. You are
going to America because you are Gussies cousin, because you have
always been his closest friend, because you are the only one of the
family who has absolutely nothing to occupy his time except golf and
night clubs.

I play a lot of auction.

And as you say, idiotic gambling in low dens. If you reuire another
reason, you are going because I ask you as a personal favour.

What she meant was that, if I refused, she would exert the full bent of
her natural genius to make life a ades for me. he held me with her
glittering eye. I have never met anyone who can give a better imitation
of the Ancient Mariner.

o you will start at once, wont you, ertie

I didnt hesitate.

ather I said. f course I will

eeves came in with the tea.

eeves, I said, we start for America on aturday.

ery good, sir, he said which suit will you wear

ew York is a large city conveniently situated on the edge of America,
so that you step off the liner right on to it without an effort. You
cant lose your way. You go out of a barn and down some stairs, and
there you are, right in among it. he only possible obection any
reasonable chappie could find to the place is that they loose you into
it from the boat at such an ungodly hour.

I left eeves to get my baggage safely past an aggregation of
suspiciousminded pirates who were digging for buried treasures among
my new shirts, and drove to Gussies hotel, where I reuested the suad
of gentlemanly clerks behind the desk to produce him.

hats where I got my first shock. e wasnt there. I pleaded with them
to think again, and they thought again, but it was no good. o Augustus
Manneringhipps on the premises.

I admit I was hard hit. here I was alone in a strange city and no
signs of Gussie. What was the next step I am never one of the master
minds in the early morning the old bean doesnt somehow seem to get
into its stride till pretty late in the p.m.s, and I couldnt think
what to do. owever, some instinct took me through a door at the back
of the lobby, and I found myself in a large room with an enormous
picture stretching across the whole of one wall, and under the picture
a counter, and behind the counter divers chappies in white, serving
drinks. hey have barmen, dont you know, in ew York, not barmaids.
um idea

I put myself unreservedly into the hands of one of the white chappies.
e was a friendly soul, and I told him the whole state of affairs. I
asked him what he thought would meet the case.

e said that in a situation of that sort he usually prescribed a
lightning whizzer, an invention of his own. e said this was what
rabbits trained on when they were matched against grizzly bears, and
there was only one instance on record of the bear having lasted three
rounds. o I tried a couple, and, by ove the man was perfectly right.
As I drained the second a great load seemed to fall from my heart, and
I went out in uite a braced way to have a look at the city.

I was surprised to find the streets uite full. eople were bustling
along as if it were some reasonable hour and not the grey dawn. In the
tramcars they were absolutely standing on each others necks. Going to
business or something, I take it. Wonderful ohnnies

he odd part of it was that after the first shock of seeing all this
frightful energy the thing didnt seem so strange. Ive spoken to
fellows since who have been to ew York, and they tell me they found it
ust the same. Apparently theres something in the air, either the
ozone or the phosphates or something, which makes you sit up and take
notice. A kind of zip, as it were. A sort of bally freedom, if you know
what I mean, that gets into your blood and bucks you up, and makes you
feel that

    Gods in is eaven
    Alls right with the world,

and you dont care if youve got odd socks on. I cant express it
better than by saying that the thought uppermost in my mind, as I
walked about the place they call imes uare, was that there were
three thousand miles of deep water between me and my Aunt Agatha.

Its a funny thing about looking for things. If you hunt for a needle
in a haystack you dont find it. If you dont give a darn whether you
ever see the needle or not it runs into you the first time you lean
against the stack. y the time I had strolled up and down once or
twice, seeing the sights and letting the white chappies corrective
permeate my system, I was feeling that I wouldnt care if Gussie and I
never met again, and Im dashed if I didnt suddenly catch sight of the
old lad, as large as life, ust turning in at a doorway down the
street.

I called after him, but he didnt hear me, so I legged it in pursuit
and caught him going into an office on the first floor. he name on the
door was Abe iesbitter, audeville Agent, and from the other side of
the door came the sound of many voices.

e turned and stared at me.

ertie What on earth are you doing Where have you sprung from When
did you arrive

anded this morning. I went round to your hotel, but they said you
werent there. hey had never heard of you.

Ive changed my name. I call myself George Wilson.

Why on earth

Well, you try calling yourself Augustus Manneringhipps over here,
and see how it strikes you. You feel a perfect ass. I dont know what
it is about America, but the broad fact is that its not a place where
you can call yourself Augustus Manneringhipps. And theres another
reason. Ill tell you later. ertie, Ive fallen in love with the
dearest girl in the world.

he poor old nut looked at me in such a deuced catlike way, standing
with his mouth open, waiting to be congratulated, that I simply hadnt
the heart to tell him that I knew all about that already, and had come
over to the country for the express purpose of laying him a stymie.

o I congratulated him.

hanks awfully, old man, he said. Its a bit premature, but I fancy
its going to be all right. Come along in here, and Ill tell you about
it.

What do you want in this place It looks a rummy spot.

h, thats part of the story. Ill tell you the whole thing.

We opened the door marked Waiting oom. I never saw such a crowded
place in my life. he room was packed till the walls bulged.

Gussie explained.

ros, he said, musichall artistes, you know, waiting to see old Abe
iesbitter. his is eptember the first, vaudevilles opening day. he
early fall, said Gussie, who is a bit of a poet in his way, is
vaudevilles springtime. All over the country, as August wanes,
sparkling comediennes burst into bloom, the sap stirs in the veins of
tramp cyclists, and last years contortionists, waking from their
summer sleep, tie themselves tentatively into knots. What I mean is,
this is the beginning of the new season, and everybodys out hunting
for bookings.

ut what do you want here

h, Ive ust got to see Abe about something. If you see a fat man
with about fiftyseven chins come out of that door there grab him, for
thatll be Abe. es one of those fellows who advertise each step up
they take in the world by growing another chin. Im told that way back
in the nineties he only had two. If you do grab Abe, remember that he
knows me as George Wilson.

You said that you were going to explain that George Wilson business to
me, Gussie, old man.

Well, its this way

At this uncture dear old Gussie broke off short, rose from his seat,
and sprang with indescribable vim at an extraordinarily stout chappie
who had suddenly appeared. here was the deuce of a rush for him, but
Gussie had got away to a good start, and the rest of the singers,
dancers, ugglers, acrobats, and refined sketch teams seemed to
recognize that he had won the trick, for they ebbed back into their
places again, and Gussie and I went into the inner room.

Mr iesbitter lit a cigar, and looked at us solemnly over his zareba of
chins.

ow, let me tell ya something, he said to Gussie. You lizzun t me.

Gussie registered respectful attention. Mr iesbitter mused for a
moment and shelled the cuspidor with indirect fire over the edge of the
desk.

izzun t me, he said again. I seen you rehearse, as I promised Miss
enison I would. You aint bad for an amateur. You gotta lot to learn,
but its in you. What it comes to is that I can fix you up in the
fouraday, if youll take thirtyfive per. I cant do better than
that, and I wouldnt have done that if the little lady hadnt of kep
after me. ake it or leave it. What do you say

Ill take it, said Gussie, huskily. hank you.

In the passage outside, Gussie gurgled with oy and slapped me on the
back. ertie, old man, its all right. Im the happiest man in ew
York.

ow what

Well, you see, as I was telling you when Abe came in, ays father
used to be in the profession. e was before our time, but I remember
hearing about himoe anby. e used to be well known in ondon before
he came over to America. Well, hes a fine old boy, but as obstinate as
a mule, and he didnt like the idea of ay marrying me because I wasnt
in the profession. Wouldnt hear of it. Well, you remember at xford I
could always sing a song pretty well so ay got hold of old iesbitter
and made him promise to come and hear me rehearse and get me bookings
if he liked my work. he stands high with him. he coached me for
weeks, the darling. And now, as you heard him say, hes booked me in
the small time at thirtyfive dollars a week.

I steadied myself against the wall. he effects of the restoratives
supplied by my pal at the hotel bar were beginning to work off, and I
felt a little weak. hrough a sort of mist I seemed to have a vision of
Aunt Agatha hearing that the head of the Manneringhippses was about
to appear on the vaudeville stage. Aunt Agathas worship of the family
name amounts to an obsession. he Manneringhippses were an
oldestablished clan when William the Conueror was a small boy going
round with bare legs and a catapult. or centuries they have called
kings by their first names and helped dukes with their weekly rent and
theres practically nothing a Manneringhipps can do that doesnt blot
his escutcheon. o what Aunt Agatha would saybeyond saying that it
was all my faultwhen she learned the horrid news, it was beyond me to
imagine.

Come back to the hotel, Gussie, I said. heres a sportsman there
who mixes things he calls lightning whizzers. omething tells me I
need one now. And excuse me for one minute, Gussie. I want to send a
cable.

It was clear to me by now that Aunt Agatha had picked the wrong man for
this ob of disentangling Gussie from the clutches of the American
vaudeville profession. What I needed was reinforcements. or a moment I
thought of cabling Aunt Agatha to come over, but reason told me that
this would be overdoing it. I wanted assistance, but not so badly as
that. I hit what seemed to me the happy mean. I cabled to Gussies
mother and made it urgent.

What were you cabling about asked Gussie, later.

h ust to say I had arrived safely, and all that sort of tosh, I
answered.

                                   

Gussie opened his vaudeville career on the following Monday at a rummy
sort of place uptown where they had moving pictures some of the time
and, in between, one or two vaudeville acts. It had taken a lot of
careful handling to bring him up to scratch. e seemed to take my
sympathy and assistance for granted, and I couldnt let him down. My
only hope, which grew as I listened to him rehearsing, was that he
would be such a frightful frost at his first appearance that he would
never dare to perform again and, as that would automatically suash
the marriage, it seemed best to me to let the thing go on.

e wasnt taking any chances. n the aturday and unday we practically
lived in a beastly little musicroom at the offices of the publishers
whose songs he proposed to use. A little chappie with a hooked nose
sucked a cigarette and played the piano all day. othing could tire
that lad. e seemed to take a personal interest in the thing.

Gussie would cleat his throat and begin

heres a great big choochoo waiting at the deepo.

 CAI playing chords Is that so Whats it waiting for

GI rather rattled at the interruption Waiting for me.

 CAI surprised or you

GI sticking to it Waiting for meeee

 CAI sceptically You dont say

GI or Im off to ennessee.

 CAI conceding a point ow, I live at Yonkers.

e did this all through the song. At first poor old Gussie asked him to
stop, but the chappie said, o, it was always done. It helped to get
pep into the thing. e appealed to me whether the thing didnt want a
bit of pep, and I said it wanted all the pep it could get. And the
chappie said to Gussie, here you are o Gussie had to stand it.

he other song that he intended to sing was one of those moon songs. e
told me in a hushed voice that he was using it because it was one of
the songs that the girl ay sang when lifting them out of their seats
at Mosensteins and elsewhere. he fact seemed to give it sacred
associations for him.

You will scarcely believe me, but the management expected Gussie to
show up and start performing at one oclock in the afternoon. I told
him they couldnt be serious, as they must know that he would be
rolling out for a bit of lunch at that hour, but Gussie said this was
the usual thing in the fouraday, and he didnt suppose he would ever
get any lunch again until he landed on the big time. I was ust
condoling with him, when I found that he was taking it for granted that
I should be there at one oclock, too. My idea had been that I should
look in at night, whenif he survivedhe would be coming up for the
fourth time but Ive never deserted a pal in distress, so I said
goodbye to the little lunch Id been planning at a rather decent
tavern Id discovered on ifth Avenue, and trailed along. hey were
showing pictures when I reached my seat. It was one of those Western
films, where the cowboy umps on his horse and rides across country at
a hundred and fifty miles an hour to escape the sheriff, not knowing,
poor chump that he might ust as well stay where he is, the sheriff
having a horse of his own which can do three hundred miles an hour
without coughing. I was ust going to close my eyes and try to forget
till they put Gussies name up when I discovered that I was sitting
next to a deucedly pretty girl.

o, let me be honest. When I went in I had seen that there was a
deucedly pretty girl sitting in that particular seat, so I had taken
the next one. What happened now was that I began, as it were, to drink
her in. I wished they would turn the lights up so that I could see her
better. he was rather small, with great big eyes and a ripping smile.
It was a shame to let all that run to seed, so to speak, in
semidarkness.

uddenly the lights did go up, and the orchestra began to play a tune
which, though I havent much of an ear for music, seemed somehow
familiar. he next instant out pranced old Gussie from the wings in a
purple frockcoat and a brown tophat, grinned feebly at the audience,
tripped over his feet, blushed, and began to sing the ennessee song.

It was rotten. he poor nut had got stage fright so badly that it
practically eliminated his voice. e sounded like some faroff echo of
the past yodelling through a woollen blanket.

or the first time since I had heard that he was about to go into
vaudeville I felt a faint hope creeping over me. I was sorry for the
wretched chap, of course, but there was no denying that the thing had
its bright side. o management on earth would go on paying thirtyfive
dollars a week for this sort of performance. his was going to be
Gussies first and only. e would have to leave the profession. he old
boy would say, nhand my daughter. And, with decent luck, I saw
myself leading Gussie on to the next nglandbound liner and handing
him over intact to Aunt Agatha.

e got through the song somehow and limped off amidst roars of silence
from the audience. here was a brief respite, then out he came again.

e sang this time as if nobody loved him. As a song, it was not a very
pathetic song, being all about coons spooning in une under the moon,
and so on and so forth, but Gussie handled it in such a sad, crushed
way that there was genuine anguish in every line. y the time he
reached the refrain I was nearly in tears. It seemed such a rotten sort
of world with all that kind of thing going on in it.

e started the refrain, and then the most frightful thing happened. he
girl next to me got up in her seat, chucked her head back, and began to
sing too. I say too, but it wasnt really too, because her first note
stopped Gussie dead, as if he had been poleaxed.

I never felt so bally conspicuous in my life. I huddled down in my seat
and wished I could turn my collar up. verybody seemed to be looking at
me.

In the midst of my agony I caught sight of Gussie. A complete change
had taken place in the old lad. e was looking most frightfully bucked.
I must say the girl was singing most awfully well, and it seemed to act
on Gussie like a tonic. When she came to the end of the refrain, he
took it up, and they sang it together, and the end of it was that he
went off the popular hero. he audience yelled for more, and were only
uieted when they turned down the lights and put on a film.

When I had recovered I tottered round to see Gussie. I found him
sitting on a box behind the stage, looking like one who had seen
visions.

Isnt she a wonder, ertie he said, devoutly. I hadnt a notion she
was going to be there. hes playing at the Auditorium this week, and
she can only ust have had time to get back to her matinee. he
risked being late, ust to come and see me through. hes my good
angel, ertie. he saved me. If she hadnt helped me out I dont know
what would have happened. I was so nervous I didnt know what I was
doing. ow that Ive got through the first show I shall be all right.

I was glad I had sent that cable to his mother. I was going to need
her. he thing had got beyond me.

                                   

uring the next week I saw a lot of old Gussie, and was introduced to
the girl. I also met her father, a formidable old boy with uick
eyebrows and a sort of determined expression. n the following
Wednesday Aunt ulia arrived. Mrs Manneringhipps, my aunt ulia, is,
I think, the most dignified person I know. he lacks Aunt Agathas
punch, but in a uiet way she has always contrived to make me feel,
from boyhood up, that I was a poor worm. ot that she harries me like
Aunt Agatha. he difference between the two is that Aunt Agatha conveys
the impression that she considers me personally responsible for all the
sin and sorrow in the world, while Aunt ulias manner seems to suggest
that I am more to be pitied than censured.

If it wasnt that the thing was a matter of historical fact, I should
be inclined to believe that Aunt ulia had never been on the vaudeville
stage. he is like a stage duchess.

he always seems to me to be in a perpetual state of being about to
desire the butler to instruct the head footman to serve lunch in the
blueroom overlooking the west terrace. he exudes dignity. Yet,
twentyfive years ago, so Ive been told by old boys who were lads
about town in those days, she was knocking them cold at the ivoli in a
double act called un in a eahop, in which she wore tights and
sang a song with a chorus that began, umptytiddleyumptyay.

here are some things a chappies mind absolutely refuses to picture,
and Aunt ulia singing umptytiddleyumptyay is one of them.

he got straight to the point within five minutes of our meeting.

What is this about Gussie Why did you cable for me, ertie

Its rather a long story, I said, and complicated. If you dont
mind, Ill let you have it in a series of motion pictures. uppose we
look in at the Auditorium for a few minutes.

he girl, ay, had been reengaged for a second week at the Auditorium,
owing to the big success of her first week. er act consisted of three
songs. he did herself well in the matter of costume and scenery. he
had a ripping voice. he looked most awfully pretty and altogether the
act was, broadly speaking, a pippin.

Aunt ulia didnt speak till we were in our seats. hen she gave a sort
of sigh.

Its twentyfive years since I was in a musichall

he didnt say any more, but sat there with her eyes glued on the
stage.

After about half an hour the ohnnies who work the cardindex system at
the side of the stage put up the name of ay enison, and there was a
good deal of applause.

Watch this act, Aunt ulia, I said.

he didnt seem to hear me.

wentyfive years What did you say, ertie

Watch this act and tell me what you think of it.

Who is it ay. h

xhibit A, I said. he girl Gussies engaged to.

he girl did her act, and the house rose at her. hey didnt want to
let her go. he had to come back again and again. When she had finally
disappeared I turned to Aunt ulia.

Well I said.

I like her work. hes an artist.

We will now, if you dont mind, step a goodish way uptown.

And we took the subway to where Gussie, the human film, was earning his
thirtyfive per. As luck would have it, we hadnt been in the place ten
minutes when out he came.

xhibit , I said. Gussie.

I dont uite know what I had expected her to do, but I certainly
didnt expect her to sit there without a word. he did not move a
muscle, but ust stared at Gussie as he drooled on about the moon. I
was sorry for the woman, for it must have been a shock to her to see
her only son in a mauve frockcoat and a brown tophat, but I thought it
best to let her get a stranglehold on the intricacies of the situation
as uickly as possible. If I had tried to explain the affair without
the aid of illustrations I should have talked all day and left her
muddled up as to who was going to marry whom, and why.

I was astonished at the improvement in dear old Gussie. e had got back
his voice and was putting the stuff over well. It reminded me of the
night at xford when, then but a lad of eighteen, he sang ets All Go
own the trand after a bump supper, standing the while up to his
knees in the college fountain. e was putting ust the same zip into
the thing now.

When he had gone off Aunt ulia sat perfectly still for a long time,
and then she turned to me. er eyes shone ueerly.

What does this mean, ertie

he spoke uite uietly, but her voice shook a bit.

Gussie went into the business, I said, because the girls father
wouldnt let him marry her unless he did. If you feel up to it perhaps
you wouldnt mind tottering round to ne undred and hirtythird
treet and having a chat with him. es an old boy with eyebrows, and
hes xhibit C on my list. When Ive put you in touch with him I rather
fancy my share of the business is concluded, and its up to you.

he anbys lived in one of those big apartments uptown which look as if
they cost the earth and really cost about half as much as a hallroom
down in the forties. We were shown into the sittingroom, and presently
old anby came in.

Good afternoon, Mr anby, I began.

I had got as far as that when there was a kind of gasping cry at my
elbow.

oe cried Aunt ulia, and staggered against the sofa.

or a moment old anby stared at her, and then his mouth fell open and
his eyebrows shot up like rockets.

ulie

And then they had got hold of each others hands and were shaking them
till I wondered their arms didnt come unscrewed.

Im not eual to this sort of thing at such short notice. he
change in Aunt ulia made me feel uite dizzy. he had shed her
grandedame manner completely, and was blushing and smiling. I
dont like to say such things of any aunt of mine, or I would go
further and put it on record that she was giggling. And old anby, who
usually looked like a cross between a oman emperor and apoleon
onaparte in a bad temper, was behaving like a small boy.

oe

ulie

ear old oe ancy meeting you again

Wherever have you come from, ulie

Well, I didnt know what it was all about, but I felt a bit out of it.
I butted in

Aunt ulia wants to have a talk with you, Mr anby.

I knew you in a second, oe

Its twentyfive years since I saw you, kid, and you dont look a day
older.

h, oe Im an old woman

What are you doing over here I supposeold anbys cheerfulness
waned a trifleI suppose your husband is with you

My husband died a long, long while ago, oe.

ld anby shook his head.

You never ought to have married out of the profession, ulie. Im
not saying a word against the lateI cant remember his name never
couldbut you shouldnt have done it, an artist like you. hall I ever
forget the way you used to knock them with umptytiddleyumptyay

Ah how wonderful you were in that act, oe. Aunt ulia sighed. o
you remember the backfall you used to do down the steps I always have
said that you did the best backfall in the profession.

I couldnt do it now

o you remember how we put it across at the Canterbury, oe hink of
it he Canterburys a movingpicture house now, and the old Mogul runs
rench revues.

Im glad Im not there to see them.

oe, tell me, why did you leave ngland

Well, II wanted a change. o Ill tell you the truth, kid. I wanted
you, ulie. You went off and married thatwhatever that stagedoor
ohnnys name wasand it broke me all up.

Aunt ulia was staring at him. he is what they call a wellpreserved
woman. Its easy to see that, twentyfive years ago, she must have been
something uite extraordinary to look at. ven now shes almost
beautiful. he has very large brown eyes, a mass of soft grey hair, and
the complexion of a girl of seventeen.

oe, you arent going to tell me you were fond of me yourself

f course I was fond of you. Why did I let you have all the fat in
un in a eahop Why did I hang about upstage while you sang
umptytiddleyumptyay o you remember my giving you a bag of buns
when we were on the road at ristol

Yes, but

o you remember my giving you the ham sandwiches at ortsmouth

oe

o you remember my giving you a seedcake at irmingham What did you
think all that meant, if not that I loved you Why, I was working up by
degrees to telling you straight out when you suddenly went off and
married that canesucking dude. hats why I wouldnt let my daughter
marry this young chap, Wilson, unless he went into the profession.
hes an artist

he certainly is, oe.

Youve seen her Where

At the Auditorium ust now. ut, oe, you mustnt stand in the way of
her marrying the man shes in love with. es an artist, too.

In the small time.

You were in the small time once, oe. You mustnt look down on him
because hes a beginner. I know you feel that your daughter is marrying
beneath her, but

ow on earth do you know anything about young Wilson

es my son.

Your son

Yes, oe. And Ive ust been watching him work. h, oe, you cant
think how proud I was of him es got it in him. Its fate. es my
son and hes in the profession oe, you dont know what Ive been
through for his sake. hey made a lady of me. I never worked so hard in
my life as I did to become a real lady. hey kept telling me I had got
to put it across, no matter what it cost, so that he wouldnt be
ashamed of me. he study was something terrible. I had to watch myself
every minute for years, and I never knew when I might fluff my lines or
fall down on some bit of business. ut I did it, because I didnt want
him to be ashamed of me, though all the time I was ust aching to be
back where I belonged.

ld anby made a ump at her, and took her by the shoulders.

Come back where you belong, ulie he cried. Your husbands dead,
your sons a pro. Come back Its twentyfive years ago, but I havent
changed. I want you still. Ive always wanted you. Youve got to come
back, kid, where you belong.

Aunt ulia gave a sort of gulp and looked at him.

oe she said in a kind of whisper.

Youre here, kid, said ld anby, huskily. Youve come back....
wentyfive years... Youve come back and youre going to stay

he pitched forward into his arms, and he caught her.

h, oe oe oe she said. old me. ont let me go. ake care of
me.

And I edged for the door and slipped from the room. I felt weak. he
old bean will stand a certain amount, but this was too much. I groped
my way out into the street and wailed for a taxi.

Gussie called on me at the hotel that night. e curveted into the room
as if he had bought it and the rest of the city.

ertie, he said, I feel as if I were dreaming.

I wish I could feel like that, old top, I said, and I took another
glance at a cable that had arrived half an hour ago from Aunt Agatha. I
had been looking at it at intervals ever since.

ay and I got back to her flat this evening. Who do you think was
there he mater he was sitting hand in hand with old anby.

Yes

e was sitting hand in hand with her.

eally

hey are going to be married.

xactly.

ay and I are going to be married.

I suppose so.

ertie, old man, I feel immense. I look round me, and everything seems
to be absolutely corking. he change in the mater is marvellous. he is
twentyfive years younger. he and old anby are talking of reviving
un in a eahop, and going out on the road with it.

I got up.

Gussie, old top, I said, leave me for a while. I would be alone. I
think Ive got brain fever or something.

orry, old man perhaps ew York doesnt agree with you. When do you
expect to go back to ngland

I looked again at Aunt Agathas cable.

With luck, I said, in about ten years.

When he was gone I took up the cable and read it again.

What is happening it read. hall I come over

I sucked a pencil for a while, and then I wrote the reply.

It was not an easy cable to word, but I managed it.

o, I wrote, stay where you are. rofession overcrowded.




WI IAY


When ack Wilton first came to Marois ay, none of us dreamed that he
was a man with a hidden sorrow in his life. here was something about
the man which made the idea absurd, or would have made it absurd if he
himself had not been the authority for the story. e looked so
thoroughly pleased with life and with himself. e was one of those men
whom you instinctively label in your mind as strong. e was so
healthy, so fit, and had such a confident, yet sympathetic, look about
him that you felt directly you saw him that here was the one person you
would have selected as the recipient of that hardluck story of yours.
You felt that his kindly strength would have been something to lean on.

As a matter of fact, it was by trying to lean on it that pencer Clay
got hold of the facts of the case and when young Clay got hold of
anything, Marois ay at large had it hot and fresh a few hours later
for pencer was one of those slackawed youths who are
constitutionally incapable of preserving a secret.

Within two hours, then, of Clays chat with Wilton, everyone in the
place knew that, olly and hearty as the newcomer might seem, there
was that gnawing at his heart which made his outward cheeriness simply
heroic.

Clay, it seems, who is the worst specimen of selfpitier, had gone to
Wilton, in whom, as a newcomer, he naturally saw a fine fresh
repository for his tales of woe, and had opened with a long yarn of
some misfortune or other. I forget which it was it might have been any
one of a dozen or so which he had constantly in stock, and it is
immaterial which it was. he point is that, having heard him out very
politely and patiently, Wilton came back at him with a story which
silenced even Clay. pencer was eual to most things, but even he could
not go on whining about how he had foozled his putting and been snubbed
at the bridgetable, or whatever it was that he was pitying himself
about ust then, when a man was telling him the story of a wrecked
life.

e told me not to let it go any further, said Clay to everyone he
met, but of course it doesnt matter telling you. It is a thing he
doesnt like to have known. e told me because he said there was
something about me that seemed to extract confidencesa kind of
strength, he said. You wouldnt think it to look at him, but his life
is an absolute blank. Absolutely ruined, dont you know. e told me the
whole thing so simply and frankly that it broke me all up. It seems
that he was engaged to be married a few years ago, and on the wedding
morningabsolutely on the wedding morningthe girl was taken suddenly
ill, and

And died

And died. ied in his arms. Absolutely in his arms, old top.

What a terrible thing

Absolutely. es never got over it. You wont let it go any further,
will you old man

And off sped pencer, to tell the tale to someone else.

                                   

veryone was terribly sorry for Wilton. e was such a good fellow, such
a sportsman, and, above all, so young, that one hated the thought that,
laugh as he might, beneath his laughter there lay the pain of that
awful memory. e seemed so happy, too. It was only in moments of
confidence, in those hearttoheart talks when men reveal their deeper
feelings, that he ever gave a hint that all was not well with him. As,
for example, when llerton, who is always in love with someone, backed
him into a corner one evening and began to tell him the story of his
latest affair, he had hardly begun when such a look of pain came over
Wiltons face that he ceased instantly. e said afterwards that the
sudden realization of the horrible break he was making hit him like a
bullet, and the manner in which he turned the conversation practically
without pausing from love to a discussion of the best method of getting
out of the bunker at the seventh hole was, in the circumstances, a
triumph of tact.

Marois ay is a uiet place even in the summer, and the Wilton tragedy
was naturally the subect of much talk. It is a sobering thing to get a
glimpse of the underlying sadness of life like that, and there was a
disposition at first on the part of the community to behave in his
presence in a manner reminiscent of pallbearers at a funeral. ut
things soon adusted themselves. e was outwardly so cheerful that it
seemed ridiculous for the rest of us to step softly and speak with
hushed voices. After all, when you came to examine it, the thing was
his affair, and it was for him to dictate the lines on which it should
be treated. If he elected to hide his pain under a bright smile and a
laugh like that of a hyena with a more than usually keen sense of
humour, our line was obviously to follow his lead.

We did so and by degrees the fact that his life was permanently
blighted became almost a legend. At the back of our minds we were aware
of it, but it did not obtrude itself into the affairs of every day. It
was only when someone, forgetting, as llerton had done, tried to
enlist his sympathy for some misfortune of his own that the look of
pain in his eyes and the sudden tightening of his lips reminded us that
he still remembered.

Matters had been at this stage for perhaps two weeks when Mary Campbell
arrived.

ex attraction is so purely a uestion of the taste of the individual
that the wise man never argues about it. e accepts its vagaries as
part of the human mystery, and leaves it at that. o me there was no
charm whatever about Mary Campbell. It may have been that, at the
moment, I was in love with Grace ates, eloise Miller, and Clarice
Wembleyfor at Marois ay, in the summer, a man who is worth his salt
is more than eual to three love affairs simultaneouslybut anyway,
she left me cold. ot one thrill could she awake in me. he was small
and, to my mind, insignificant. ome men said that she had fine eyes.
hey seemed to me ust ordinary eyes. And her hair was ust ordinary
hair. In fact, ordinary was the word that described her.

ut from the first it was plain that she seemed wonderful with Wilton,
which was all the more remarkable, seeing that he was the one man of us
all who could have got any girl in Marois ay that he wanted. When a
man is six foot high, is a combination of ercules and Apollo, and
plays tennis, golf, and the bano with almost superhuman vim, his path
with the girls of a summer seaside resort is pretty smooth. ut, when
you add to all these things a tragedy like Wiltons, he can only be
described as having a walkover.

Girls love a tragedy. At least, most girls do. It makes a man
interesting to them. Grace ates was always going on about how
interesting Wilton was. o was eloise Miller. o was Clarice Wembley.
ut it was not until Mary Campbell came that he displayed any real
enthusiasm at all for the feminine element of Marois ay. We put it
down to the fact that he could not forget, but the real reason, I now
know, was that he considered that girls were a nuisance on the links
and in the tenniscourt. I suppose a plus two golfer and a Wildingesue
tennisplayer, such as Wilton was, does feel like that. ersonally, I
think that girls add to the fun of the thing. ut then, my handicap is
twelve, and, though I have been playing tennis for many years, I doubt
if I have got my first servethe fast oneover the net more than half
a dozen times.

ut Mary Campbell overcame Wiltons preudices in twentyfour hours. e
seemed to feel lonely on the links without her, and he positively egged
her to be his partner in the doubles. What Mary thought of him we did
not know. he was one of those inscrutable girls.

And so things went on. If it had not been that I knew Wiltons story, I
should have classed the thing as one of those summer loveaffairs to
which the Marois ay air is so peculiarly conducive. he only reason
why anyone comes away from a summer at Marois ay unbetrothed is
because there are so many girls that he falls in love with that his
holiday is up before he can, so to speak, concentrate.

ut in Wiltons case this was out of the uestion. A man does not get
over the sort of blow he had had, not, at any rate, for many years and
we had gathered that his tragedy was comparatively recent.

I doubt if I was ever more astonished in my life than the night when he
confided in me. Why he should have chosen me as a confidant I cannot
say. I am inclined to think that I happened to be alone with him at the
psychological moment when a man must confide in somebody or burst and
Wilton chose the lesser evil.

I was strolling along the shore after dinner, smoking a cigar and
thinking of Grace ates, eloise Miller, and Clarice Wembley, when I
happened upon him. It was a beautiful night, and we sat down and drank
it in for a while. he first intimation I had that all was not well
with him was when he suddenly emitted a hollow groan.

he next moment he had begun to confide.

Im in the deuce of a hole, he said. What would you do in my
position

Yes I said.

I proposed to Mary Campbell this evening.

Congratulations.

hanks. he refused me.

efused you

Yesbecause of Amy.

It seemed to me that the narrative reuired footnotes.

Who is Amy I said.

Amy is the girl

Which girl

he girl who died, you know. Mary had got hold of the whole story. In
fact, it was the tremendous sympathy she showed that encouraged me to
propose. If it hadnt been for that, I shouldnt have had the nerve.
Im not fit to black her shoes.

dd, the poor opinion a man always haswhen he is in loveof his
personal attractions. here were times when I thought of Grace ates,
eloise Miller, and Clarice Wembley, when I felt like one of the beasts
that perish. ut then, Im nothing to write home about, whereas the
smallest gleam of intelligence should have told Wilton that he was a
kind of uida guardsman.

his evening I managed somehow to do it. he was tremendously nice
about itsaid she was very fond of me and all thatbut it was uite
out of the uestion because of Amy.

I dont follow this. What did she mean

Its perfectly clear, if you bear in mind that Mary is the most
sensitive, spiritual, highly strung girl that ever drew breath, said
Wilton, a little coldly. er position is this she feels that, because
of Amy, she can never have my love completely between us there would
always be Amys memory. It would be the same as if she married a
widower.

Well, widowers marry.

hey dont marry girls like Mary.

I couldnt help feeling that this was a bit of luck for the widowers
but I didnt say so. ne has always got to remember that opinions
differ about girls. ne mans peach, so to speak, is another mans
poison. I have met men who didnt like Grace ates, men who, if eloise
Miller or Clarice Wembley had given them their photographs, would have
used them to cut the pages of a novel.

Amy stands between us, said Wilton.

I breathed a sympathetic snort. I couldnt think of anything noticeably
suitable to say.

tands between us, repeated Wilton. And the damn silly part of the
whole thing is that there isnt any Amy. I invented her.

Youwhat

Invented her. Made her up. o, Im not mad. I had a reason. et me
see, you come from ondon, dont you

Yes.

hen you havent any friends. Its different with me. I live in a
small country town, and everyones my friend. I dont know what it is
about me, but for some reason, ever since I can remember, Ive been
looked on as the strong man of my town, the man whos all right.
Am I making myself clear

ot uite.

Well, what I am trying to get at is this. ither because Im a strong
sort of fellow to look at, and have obviously never been sick in my
life, or because I cant help looking pretty cheerful, the whole of
ridleyintheWold seems to take it for granted that I cant possibly
have any troubles of my own, and that I am conseuently fair game for
anyone who has any sort of worry. I have the sympathetic manner, and
they come to me to be cheered up. If a fellows in love, he makes a
beeline for me, and tells me all about it. If anyone has had a
bereavement, I am the rock on which he leans for support. Well, Im a
patient sort of man, and, as far as ridleyintheWold is concerned, I
am willing to play the part. ut a strong man does need an occasional
holiday, and I made up my mind that I would get it. irectly I got here
I saw that the same old game was going to start. pencer Clay swooped
down on me at once. Im as big a draw with the pencer Clay type of
maudlin idiot as catnip is with a cat. Well, I could stand it at home,
but I was hanged if I was going to have my holiday spoiled. o I
invented Amy. ow do you see

Certainly I see. And I perceive something else which you appear to
have overlooked. If Amy doesnt existor, rather, never did existshe
cannot stand between you and Miss Campbell. ell her what you have told
me, and all will be well.

e shook his head.

You dont know Mary. he would never forgive me. You dont know what
sympathy, what angelic sympathy, she has poured out on me about Amy. I
cant possibly tell her the whole thing was a fraud. It would make her
feel so foolish.

You must risk it. At the worst, you lose nothing.

e brightened a little.

o, thats true, he said. Ive half a mind to do it.

Make it a whole mind, I said, and you win out.

I was wrong. ometimes I am. he trouble was, apparently, that I didnt
know Mary. I am sure Grace ates, eloise Miller, or Clarice Wembley
would not have acted as she did. hey might have been a trifle stunned
at first, but they would soon have come round, and all would have been
oy. ut with Mary, no. What took place at the interview I do not know
but it was swiftly perceived by Marois ay that the WiltonCampbell
alliance was off. hey no longer walked together, golfed together, and
played tennis on the same side of the net. hey did not even speak to
each other.

                              

he rest of the story I can speak of only from hearsay. ow it became
public property, I do not know. ut there was a confiding strain in
Wilton, and I imagine he confided in someone, who confided in someone
else. At any rate, it is recorded in Marois ays unwritten archives,
from which I now extract it.

                              

or some days after the breakingoff of diplomatic relations, Wilton
seemed too pulverized to resume the offensive. e mooned about the
links by himself, playing a shocking game, and generally comported
himself like a man who has looked for the escape of gas with a lighted
candle. In affairs of love the strongest men generally behave with the
most spineless lack of resolution. Wilton weighed thirteen stone, and
his muscles were like steel cables but he could not have shown less
pluck in this crisis in his life if he had been a poached egg. It was
pitiful to see him.

Mary, in these days, simply couldnt see that he was on the earth. he
looked round him, above him, and through him, but never at him which
was rotten from Wiltons point of view, for he had developed a sort of
wistful expressionI am convinced that he practised it before the
mirror after his bathwhich should have worked wonders, if only he
could have got action with it. ut she avoided his eye as if he had
been a creditor whom she was trying to slide past on the street.

he irritated me. o let the breach widen in this way was absurd.
Wilton, when I said as much to him, said that it was due to her
wonderful sensitiveness and highly strungness, and that it was ust one
more proof to him of the loftiness of her soul and her shrinking horror
of any form of deceit. In fact, he gave me the impression that, though
the affair was rending his vitals, he took a mournful pleasure in
contemplating her perfection.

ow one afternoon Wilton took his misery for a long walk along the
seashore. e tramped over the sand for some considerable time, and
finally pulled up in a little cove, backed by high cliffs and dotted
with rocks. he shore around Marois ay is full of them.

y this time the afternoon sun had begun to be too warm for comfort,
and it struck Wilton that he could be a great deal more comfortable
nursing his wounded heart with his back against one of the rocks than
tramping any farther over the sand. Most of the Marois ay scenery is
simply made as a setting for the nursing of a wounded heart. he cliffs
are a sombre indigo, sinister and forbidding and even on the finest
days the sea has a curious sullen look. You have only to get away from
the crowd near the bathingmachines and reach one of these small coves
and get your book against a rock and your pipe well alight, and you can
simply wallow in misery. I have done it myself. he day when eloise
Miller went golfing with eddy ingley I spent the whole afternoon in
one of these retreats. It is true that, after twenty minutes of
contemplating the breakers, I fell asleep but that is bound to happen.

It happened to Wilton. or perhaps half an hour he brooded, and then
his pipe fell from his mouth and he dropped off into a peaceful
slumber. And time went by.

It was a touch of cramp that finally woke him. e umped up with a
yell, and stood there massaging his calf. And he had hardly got rid of
the pain, when a startled exclamation broke the primeval stillness and
there, on the other side of the rock, was Mary Campbell.

ow, if Wilton had had any inductive reasoning in his composition at
all, he would have been tremendously elated. A girl does not creep out
to a distant cove at Marois ay unless she is unhappy and if Mary
Campbell was unhappy she must be unhappy about him and if she was
unhappy about him all he had to do was to show a bit of determination
and get the whole thing straightened out. ut Wilton, whom grief had
reduced to the mental level of an oyster, did not reason this out and
the sight of her deprived him of practically all his faculties,
including speech. e ust stood there and yammered.

id you follow me here, Mr Wilton said Mary, very coldly.

e shook his head. ventually he managed to say that he had come there
by chance, and had fallen asleep under the rock. As this was exactly
what Mary had done, she could not reasonably complain. o that
concluded the conversation for the time being. he walked away in the
direction of Marois ay without another word, and presently he lost
sight of her round a bend in the cliffs.

is position now was exceedingly unpleasant. If she had such a distaste
for his presence, common decency made it imperative that he should give
her a good start on the homeward ourney. e could not tramp along a
couple of yards in the rear all the way. o he had to remain where he
was till she had got well off the mark. And as he was wearing a thin
flannel suit, and the sun had gone in, and a chilly breeze had sprung
up, his mental troubles were practically swamped in physical
discomfort.

ust as he had decided that he could now make a move, he was surprised
to see her coming back.

Wilton really was elated at this. he construction he put on it was
that she had relented and was coming back to fling her arms round his
neck. e was ust bracing himself for the clash, when he caught her
eye, and it was as cold and unfriendly as the sea.

I must go round the other way, she said. he water has come up too
far on that side.

And she walked past him to the other end of the cove.

he prospect of another wait chilled Wilton to the marrow. he wind had
now grown simply freezing, and it came through his thin suit and roamed
about all over him in a manner that caused him exuisite discomfort. e
began to ump to keep himself warm.

e was leaping heavenwards for the hundredth time, when, chancing to
glance to one side, he perceived Mary again returning. y this time his
physical misery had so completely overcome the softer emotions in his
bosom that his only feeling now was one of thorough irritation. It was
not fair, he felt, that she should ockey at the start in this way and
keep him hanging about here catching cold. e looked at her, when she
came within range, uite balefully.

It is impossible, she said, to get round that way either.

ne grows so accustomed in this world to everything going smoothly,
that the idea of actual danger had not yet come home to her. rom where
she stood in the middle of the cove, the sea looked so distant that the
fact that it had closed the only ways of getting out was at the moment
merely annoying. he felt much the same as she would have felt if she
had arrived at a station to catch a train and had been told that the
train was not running.

he therefore seated herself on a rock, and contemplated the ocean.
Wilton walked up and down. either showed any disposition to exercise
that gift of speech which places Man in a class of his own, above the
ox, the ass, the common warthog, and the rest of the lower animals. It
was only when a wave swished over the base of her rock that Mary broke
the silence.

he tide is coming in she faltered.

he looked at the sea with such altered feelings that it seemed a
different sea altogether.

here was plenty of it to look at. It filled the entire mouth of the
little bay, swirling up the sand and lashing among the rocks in a
fashion which made one thought stand out above all the others in her
mindthe recollection that she could not swim.

Mr Wilton

Wilton bowed coldly.

Mr Wilton, the tide. Its coming I.

Wilton glanced superciliously at the sea.

o, he said, I perceive.

ut what shall we do

Wilton shrugged his shoulders. e was feeling at war with ature and
umanity combined. he wind had shifted a few points to the east, and
was exploring his anatomy with the skill of a ualified surgeon.

We shall drown, cried Miss Campbell. We shall drown. We shall drown.
We shall drown.

All Wiltons resentment left him. ntil he heard that pitiful wail his
only thoughts had been for himself.

Mary he said, with a wealth of tenderness in his voice.

he came to him as a little child comes to its mother, and he put his
arm around her.

h, ack

My darling

Im frightened

My precious

It is in moments of peril, when the chill breath of fear blows upon our
souls, clearing them of pettiness, that we find ourselves.

he looked about her wildly.

Could we climb the cliffs

I doubt it.

If we called for help

We could do that.

hey raised their voices, but the only answer was the crashing of the
waves and the cry of the seabirds. he water was swirling at their
feet, and they drew back to the shelter of the cliffs. here they stood
in silence, watching.

Mary, said Wilton in a low voice, tell me one thing.

Yes, ack

ave you forgiven me

orgiven you ow can you ask at a moment like this I love you with
all my heart and soul.

e kissed her, and a strange look of peace came over his face.

I am happy.

I, too.

A fleck of foam touched her face, and she shivered.

It was worth it, he said uietly. If all misunderstandings are
cleared away and nothing can come between us again, it is a small price
to payunpleasant as it will be when it comes.

erhapsperhaps it will not be very unpleasant. hey say that
drowning is an easy death.

I didnt mean drowning, dearest. I meant a cold in the head.

A cold in the head

e nodded gravely.

I dont see how it can be avoided. You know how chilly it gets these
late summer nights. It will be a long time before we can get away.

he laughed a shrill, unnatural laugh.

You are talking like this to keep my courage up. You know in your

Why didnt you tell me she cried.

I did tell you.

You know what I mean. Why did you let me go on thinking we were in

We were in danger. We shall probably get pneumonia.

I am not sneezing. hat was an exclamation of disgust.

It sounded like a sneeze. It must have been, for youve every reason

Well, its not true any longer.

 MI


I. e Meets a hy Gentleman

ooking back, I always consider that my career as a dog proper really
started when I was bought for the sum of half a crown by the hy Man.
hat event marked the end of my puppyhood. he knowledge that I was
worth actual cash to somebody filled me with a sense of new
responsibilities. It sobered me. esides, it was only after that
halfcrown changed hands that I went out into the great world and,
however interesting life may be in an ast nd publichouse, it is only
when you go out into the world that you really broaden your mind and
begin to see things.

Within its limitations, my life had been singularly full and vivid. I
was born, as I say, in a publichouse in the ast nd, and, however
lacking a publichouse may be in refinement and the true culture, it
certainly provides plenty of excitement. efore I was six weeks old I
had upset three policemen by getting between their legs when they came
round to the sidedoor, thinking they had heard suspicious noises and
I can still recall the interesting sensation of being chased seventeen
times round the yard with a broomhandle after a wellplanned and
completely successful raid on the larder. hese and other happenings of
a like nature soothed for the moment but could not cure the
restlessness which has always been so marked a trait in my character. I
have always been restless, unable to settle down in one place and
anxious to get on to the next thing. his may be due to a gipsy strain
in my ancestryone of my uncles travelled with a circusor it may be
the Artistic emperament, acuired from a grandfather who, before dying
of a surfeit of paste in the propertyroom of the ristol Coliseum,
which he was visiting in the course of a professional tour, had an
established reputation on the musichall stage as one of rofessor
onds erforming oodles.

I owe the fullness and variety of my life to this restlessness of mine,
for I have repeatedly left comfortable homes in order to follow some
perfect stranger who looked as if he were on his way to somewhere
interesting. ometimes I think I must have cat blood in me.

he hy Man came into our yard one afternoon in April, while I was
sleeping with mother in the sun on an old sweater which we had borrowed
from red, one of the barmen. I heard mother growl, but I didnt take
any notice. Mother is what they call a good watchdog, and she growls
at everybody except master. At first, when she used to do it, I would
get up and bark my head off, but not now. ifes too short to bark at
everybody who comes into our yard. It is behind the publichouse, and
they keep empty bottles and things there, so people are always coming
and going.

esides, I was tired. I had had a very busy morning, helping the men
bring in a lot of cases of beer, and running into the saloon to talk to
red and generally looking after things. o I was ust dozing off
again, when I heard a voice say, Well, hes ugly enough hen I knew
that they were talking about me.

I have never disguised it from myself, and nobody has ever disguised it
from me, that I am not a handsome dog. ven mother never thought me
beautiful. he was no Gladys Cooper herself, but she never hesitated to
criticize my appearance. In fact, I have yet to meet anyone who did.
he first thing strangers say about me is, What an ugly dog

I dont know what I am. I have a bulldog kind of a face, but the rest
of me is terrier. I have a long tail which sticks straight up in the
air. My hair is wiry. My eyes are brown. I am et black, with a white
chest. I once overheard red saying that I was a Gorgonzola
cheesehound, and I have generally found red reliable in his
statements.

When I found that I was under discussion, I opened my eyes. Master was
standing there, looking down at me, and by his side the man who had
ust said I was ugly enough. he man was a thin man, about the age of a
barman and smaller than a policeman. e had patched brown shoes and
black trousers.

ut hes got a sweet nature, said master.

his was true, luckily for me. Mother always said, A dog without
influence or private means, if he is to make his way in the world, must
have either good looks or amiability. ut, according to her, I overdid
it. A dog, she used to say, can have a good heart, without chumming
with every om, ick, and arry he meets. Your behaviour is sometimes
uite undoglike. Mother prided herself on being a oneman dog. he
kept herself to herself, and wouldnt kiss anybody except masternot
even red.

ow, Im a mixer. I cant help it. Its my nature. I like men. I like
the taste of their boots, the smell of their legs, and the sound of
their voices. It may be weak of me, but a man has only to speak to me
and a sort of thrill goes right down my spine and sets my tail wagging.

I wagged it now. he man looked at me rather distantly. e didnt pat
me. I suspectedwhat I afterwards found to be the casethat he was
shy, so I umped up at him to put him at his ease. Mother growled
again. I felt that she did not approve.

Why, hes took uite a fancy to you already, said master.

he man didnt say a word. e seemed to be brooding on something. e
was one of those silent men. e reminded me of oe, the old dog down
the street at the grocers shop, who lies at the door all day, blinking
and not speaking to anybody.

Master began to talk about me. It surprised me, the way he praised me.
I hadnt a suspicion he admired me so much. rom what he said you would
have thought I had won prizes and ribbons at the Crystal alace. ut
the man didnt seem to be impressed. e kept on saying nothing.

When master had finished telling him what a wonderful dog I was till I
blushed, the man spoke.

ess of it, he said. alf a crown is my bid, and if he was an angel
from on high you couldnt get another hapenny out of me. What about
it

A thrill went down my spine and out at my tail, for of course I saw now
what was happening. he man wanted to buy me and take me away. I looked
at master hopefully.

es more like a son to me than a dog, said master, sort of wistful.

Its his face that makes you feel that way, said the man,
unsympathetically. If you had a son thats ust how he would look.
alf a crown is my offer, and Im in a hurry.

All right, said master, with a sigh, though its giving him away, a
valuable dog like that. Wheres your halfcrown

he man got a bit of rope and tied it round my neck.

I could hear mother barking advice and telling me to be a credit to the
family, but I was too excited to listen.

Goodbye, mother, I said. Goodbye, master. Goodbye, red. Goodbye
everybody. Im off to see life. he hy Man has bought me for half a
crown. Wow

I kept running round in circles and shouting, till the man gave me a
kick and told me to stop it.

o I did.

I dont know where we went, but it was a long way. I had never been off
our street before in my life and I didnt know the whole world was half
as big as that. We walked on and on, and the man erked at my rope
whenever I wanted to stop and look at anything. e wouldnt even let me
pass the time of the day with dogs we met.

When we had gone about a hundred miles and were ust going to turn in
at a dark doorway, a policeman suddenly stopped the man. I could feel
by the way the man pulled at my rope and tried to hurry on that he
didnt want to speak to the policeman. he more I saw of the man the
more I saw how shy he was.

i said the policeman, and we had to stop.

Ive got a message for you, old pal, said the policeman. Its from
the oard of ealth. hey told me to tell you you needed a change of
air. ee

All right said the man.

And take it as soon as you like. lse youll find youll get it given
you. ee

I looked at the man with a good deal of respect. e was evidently
someone very important, if they worried so about his health.

Im going down to the country tonight, said the man.

he policeman seemed pleased.

hats a bit of luck for the country, he said. ont go changing
your mind.

And we walked on, and went in at the dark doorway, and climbed about a
million stairs and went into a room that smelt of rats. he man sat
down and swore a little, and I sat and looked at him.

resently I couldnt keep it in any longer.

o we live here I said. Is it true were going to the country
Wasnt that policeman a good sort ont you like policemen I knew
lots of policemen at the publichouse. Are there any other dogs here
What is there for dinner Whats in that cupboard When are you going
to take me out for another run May I go out and see if I can find a
cat

top that yelping, he said.

When we go to the country, where shall we live Are you going to be a
caretaker at a house reds father is a caretaker at a big house in
ent. Ive heard red talk about it. You didnt meet red when you came
to the publichouse, did you You would like red. I like red. Mother
likes red. We all like red.

I was going on to tell him a lot more about red, who had always been
one of my warmest friends, when he suddenly got hold of a stick and
walloped me with it.

You keep uiet when youre told, he said.

e really was the shyest man I had ever met. It seemed to hurt him to
be spoken to. owever, he was the boss, and I had to humour him, so I
didnt say any more.

We went down to the country that night, ust as the man had told the
policeman we would. I was all worked up, for I had heard so much about
the country from red that I had always wanted to go there. red used
to go off on a motorbicycle sometimes to spend the night with his
father in ent, and once he brought back a suirrel with him, which I
thought was for me to eat, but mother said no. he first thing a dog
has to learn, mother used often to say, is that the whole world
wasnt created for him to eat.

It was uite dark when we got to the country, but the man seemed to
know where to go. e pulled at my rope, and we began to walk along a
road with no people in it at all. We walked on and on, but it was all
so new to me that I forgot how tired I was. I could feel my mind
broadening with every step I took.

very now and then we would pass a very big house, which looked as if
it was empty, but I knew that there was a caretaker inside, because of
reds father. hese big houses belong to very rich people, but they
dont want to live in them till the summer, so they put in caretakers,
and the caretakers have a dog to keep off burglars. I wondered if that
was what I had been brought here for.

Are you going to be a caretaker I asked the man.

hut up, he said.

o I shut up.

After we had been walking a long time, we came to a cottage. A man came
out. My man seemed to know him, for he called him ill. I was uite
surprised to see the man was not at all shy with ill. hey seemed very
friendly.

Is that him said ill, looking at me.

ought him this afternoon, said the man.

Well, said ill, hes ugly enough. e looks fierce. If you want a
dog, hes the sort of dog you want. ut what do you want one for It
seems to me its a lot of trouble to take, when theres no need of any
trouble at all. Why not do what Ive always wanted to do Whats wrong
with ust fixing the dog, same as its always done, and walking in and
helping yourself

Ill tell you whats wrong, said the man. o start with, you cant
get at the dog to fix him except by day, when they let him out. At
night hes shut up inside the house. And suppose you do fix him during
the day what happens then ither the bloke gets another before night,
or else he sits up all night with a gun. It isnt like as if these
blokes was ordinary blokes. heyre down here to look after the house.
hats their ob, and they dont take any chances.

It was the longest speech I had ever heard the man make, and it seemed
to impress ill. e was uite humble.

I didnt think of that, he said. Wed best start in to train this
tyke at once.

Mother often used to say, when I went on about wanting to go out into
the world and see life, Youll be sorry when you do. he world isnt
all bones and liver. And I hadnt been living with the man and ill in
their cottage long before I found out how right she was.

It was the mans shyness that made all the trouble. It seemed as if he
hated to be taken notice of.

It started on my very first night at the cottage. I had fallen asleep
in the kitchen, tired out after all the excitement of the day and the
long walks I had had, when something woke me with a start. It was
somebody scratching at the window, trying to get in.

Well, I ask you, I ask any dog, what would you have done in my place
ver since I was old enough to listen, mother had told me over and over
again what I must do in a case like this. It is the A  C of a dogs
education. If you are in a room and you hear anyone trying to get in,
mother used to say, bark. It may be someone who has business there, or
it may not. ark first, and inuire afterwards. ogs were made to be
heard and not seen.

I lifted my head and yelled. I have a good, deep voice, due to a hound
strain in my pedigree, and at the publichouse, when there was a full
moon, I have often had people leaning out of the windows and saying
things all down the street. I took a deep breath and let it go.

Man I shouted. ill Man Come uick eres a burglar getting in

hen somebody struck a light, and it was the man himself. e had come
in through the window.

e picked up a stick, and he walloped me. I couldnt understand it. I
couldnt see where I had done the wrong thing. ut he was the boss, so
there was nothing to be said.

If youll believe me, that same thing happened every night. very
single night And sometimes twice or three times before morning. And
every time I would bark my loudest and the man would strike a light and
wallop me. he thing was baffling. I couldnt possibly have mistaken
what mother had said to me. he said it too often for that. ark ark
ark It was the main plank of her whole system of education. And yet,
here I was, getting walloped every night for doing it.

I thought it out till my head ached, and finally I got it right. I
began to see that mothers outlook was narrow. o doubt, living with a
man like master at the publichouse, a man without a trace of shyness
in his composition, barking was all right. ut circumstances alter
cases. I belonged to a man who was a mass of nerves, who got the umps
if you spoke to him. What I had to do was to forget the training I had
had from mother, sound as it no doubt was as a general thing, and to
adapt myself to the needs of the particular man who had happened to buy
me. I had tried mothers way, and all it had brought me was walloping,
so now I would think for myself.

o next night, when I heard the window go, I lay there without a word,
though it went against all my better feelings. I didnt even growl.
omeone came in and moved about in the dark, with a lantern, but,
though I smelt that it was the man, I didnt ask him a single uestion.
And presently the man lit a light and came over to me and gave me a
pat, which was a thing he had never done before.

Good dog he said. ow you can have this.

And he let me lick out the saucepan in which the dinner had been
cooked.

After that, we got on fine. Whenever I heard anyone at the window I
ust kept curled up and took no notice, and every time I got a bone or
something good. It was easy, once you had got the hang of things.

It was about a week after that the man took me out one morning, and we
walked a long way till we turned in at some big gates and went along a
very smooth road till we came to a great house, standing all by itself
in the middle of a whole lot of country. here was a big lawn in front
of it, and all round there were fields and trees, and at the back a
great wood.

he man rang a bell, and the door opened, and an old man came out.

Well he said, not very cordially.

I thought you might want to buy a good watchdog, said the man.

Well, thats ueer, your saying that, said the caretaker. Its a
coincidence. hats exactly what I do want to buy. I was ust thinking
of going along and trying to get one. My old dog picked up something
this morning that he oughtnt to have, and hes dead, poor feller.

oor feller, said the man. ound an old bone with phosphorus on it,
I guess.

What do you want for this one

ive shillings.

Is he a good watchdog

es a grand watchdog.

e looks fierce enough.

Ah

o the caretaker gave the man his five shillings, and the man went off
and left me.

At first the newness of everything and the unaccustomed smells and
getting to know the caretaker, who was a nice old man, prevented my
missing the man, but as the day went on and I began to realize that he
had gone and would never come back, I got very depressed. I pattered
all over the house, whining. It was a most interesting house, bigger
than I thought a house could possibly be, but it couldnt cheer me up.
You may think it strange that I should pine for the man, after all the
wallopings he had given me, and it is odd, when you come to think of
it. ut dogs are dogs, and they are built like that. y the time it was
evening I was thoroughly miserable. I found a shoe and an old
clothesbrush in one of the rooms, but could eat nothing. I ust sat
and moped.

Its a funny thing, but it seems as if it always happened that ust
when you are feeling most miserable, something nice happens. As I sat
there, there came from outside the sound of a motorbicycle, and
somebody shouted.

It was dear old red, my old pal red, the best old boy that ever
stepped. I recognized his voice in a second, and I was scratching at
the door before the old man had time to get up out of his chair.

Well, well, well hat was a pleasant surprise I ran five times round
the lawn without stopping, and then I came back and umped up at him.

What are you doing down here, red I said. Is this caretaker your
father ave you seen the rabbits in the wood ow long are you going
to stop ows mother I like the country. ave you come all the way
from the publichouse Im living here now. Your father gave five
shillings for me. hats twice as much as I was worth when I saw you
last.

Why, its young igger hat was what they called me at the saloon.
What are you doing here Where did you get this dog, father

A man sold him to me this morning. oor old ob got poisoned. his one
ought to be ust as good a watchdog. e barks loud enough.

e should be. is mother is the best watchdog in ondon. his
cheesehound used to belong to the boss. unny him getting down here.

We went into the house and had supper. And after supper we sat and
talked. red was only down for the night, he said, because the boss
wanted him back next day.

And Id sooner have my ob, than yours, dad, he said. f all the
lonely places I wonder you arent scared of burglars.

Ive my shotgun, and theres the dog. I might be scared if it wasnt
for him, but he kind of gives me confidence. ld ob was the same. ogs
are a comfort in the country.

Get many tramps here

Ive only seen one in two months, and thats the feller who sold me
the dog here.

As they were talking about the man, I asked red if he knew him. hey
might have met at the publichouse, when the man was buying me from the
boss.

You would like him, I said. I wish you could have met.

hey both looked at me.

Whats he growling at asked red. hink he heard something

he old man laughed.

e wasnt growling. e was talking in his sleep. Youre nervous, red.
It comes of living in the city.

Well, I am. I like this place in the daytime, but it gives me the pip
at night. Its so uiet. ow you can stand it here all the time, I
cant understand. wo nights of it would have me seeing things.

is father laughed.

If you feel like that, red, you had better take the gun to bed with
you. I shall be uite happy without it.

I will, said red. Ill take six if youve got them.

And after that they went upstairs. I had a basket in the hall, which
had belonged to ob, the dog who had got poisoned. It was a comfortable
basket, but I was so excited at having met red again that I couldnt
sleep. esides, there was a smell of mice somewhere, and I had to move
around, trying to place it.

I was ust sniffing at a place in the wall, when I heard a scratching
noise. At first I thought it was the mice working in a different place,
but, when I listened, I found that the sound came from the window.
omebody was doing something to it from outside.

If it had been mother, she would have lifted the roof off right there,
and so should I, if it hadnt been for what the man had taught me. I
didnt think it possible that this could be the man come back, for he
had gone away and said nothing about ever seeing me again. ut I didnt
bark. I stopped where I was and listened. And presently the window came
open, and somebody began to climb in.

I gave a good sniff, and I knew it was the man.

I was so delighted that for a moment I nearly forgot myself and shouted
with oy, but I remembered in time how shy he was, and stopped myself.
ut I ran to him and umped up uite uietly, and he told me to lie
down. I was disappointed that he didnt seem more pleased to see me. I
lay down.

It was very dark, but he had brought a lantern with him, and I could
see him moving about the room, picking things up and putting them in a
bag which he had brought with him. very now and then he would stop and
listen, and then he would start moving round again. e was very uick
about it, but very uiet. It was plain that he didnt want red or his
father to come down and find him.

I kept thinking about this peculiarity of his while I watched him. I
suppose, being chummy myself, I find it hard to understand that
everybody else in the world isnt chummy too. f course, my experience
at the publichouse had taught me that men are ust as different from
each other as dogs. If I chewed masters shoe, for instance, he used to
kick me but if I chewed reds, red would tickle me under the ear.
And, similarly, some men are shy and some men are mixers. I uite
appreciated that, but I couldnt help feeling that the man carried
shyness to a point where it became morbid. And he didnt give himself a
chance to cure himself of it. hat was the point. Imagine a man hating
to meet people so much that he never visited their houses till the
middle of the night, when they were in bed and asleep. It was silly.
hyness has always been something so outside my nature that I suppose I
have never really been able to look at it sympathetically. I have
always held the view that you can get over it if you make an effort.
he trouble with the man was that he wouldnt make an effort. e went
out of his way to avoid meeting people.

I was fond of the man. e was the sort of person you never get to know
very well, but we had been together for uite a while, and I wouldnt
have been a dog if I hadnt got attached to him.

As I sat and watched him creep about the room, it suddenly came to me
that here was a chance of doing him a real good turn in spite of
himself. red was upstairs, and red, as I knew by experience, was the
easiest man to get along with in the world. obody could be shy with
red. I felt that if only I could bring him and the man together, they
would get along splendidly, and it would teach the man not to be silly
and avoid people. It would help to give him the confidence which he
needed. I had seen him with ill, and I knew that he could be perfectly
natural and easy when he liked.

It was true that the man might obect at first, but after a while he
would see that I had acted simply for his good, and would be grateful.

he difficulty was, how to get red down without scaring the man. I
knew that if I shouted he wouldnt wait, but would be out of the window
and away before red could get there. What I had to do was to go to
reds room, explain the whole situation uietly to him, and ask him to
come down and make himself pleasant.

he man was far too busy to pay any attention to me. e was kneeling in
a corner with his back to me, putting something in his bag. I seized
the opportunity to steal softly from the room.

reds door was shut, and I could hear him snoring. I scratched gently,
and then harder, till I heard the snores stop. e got out of bed and
opened the door.

ont make a noise, I whispered. Come on downstairs. I want you to
meet a friend of mine.

At first he was uite peevish.

Whats the idea, he said, coming and spoiling a mans beautysleep
Get out.

e actually started to go back into the room.

o, honestly, red, I said, Im not fooling you. here is a man
downstairs. e got in through the window. I want you to meet him. es
very shy, and I think it will do him good to have a chat with you.

What are you whining about red began, and then he broke off
suddenly and listened. We could both hear the mans footsteps as he
moved about.

red umped back into the room. e came out, carrying something. e
didnt say any more but started to go downstairs, very uiet, and I
went after him.

here was the man, still putting things in his bag. I was ust going to
introduce red, when red, the silly ass, gave a great yell.

I could have bitten him.

What did you want to do that for, you chump I said I told you he
was shy. ow youve scared him.

e certainly had. he man was out of the window uicker than you would
have believed possible. e ust flew out. I called after him that it
was only red and me, but at that moment a gun went off with a
tremendous bang, so he couldnt have heard me.

I was pretty sick about it. he whole thing had gone wrong. red seemed
to have lost his head entirely. e was behaving like a perfect ass.
aturally the man had been frightened with him carrying on in that way.
I umped out of the window to see if I could find the man and explain,
but he was gone. red umped out after me, and nearly suashed me.

It was pitch dark out there. I couldnt see a thing. ut I knew the man
could not have gone far, or I should have heard him. I started to sniff
round on the chance of picking up his trail. It wasnt long before I
struck it.

reds father had come down now, and they were running about. he old
man had a light. I followed the trail, and it ended at a large
cedartree, not far from the house. I stood underneath it and looked
up, but of course I could not see anything.

Are you up there I shouted. heres nothing to be scared at. It was
only red. es an old pal of mine. e works at the place where you
bought me. is gun went off by accident. e wont hurt you.

here wasnt a sound. I began to think I must have made a mistake.

es got away, I heard red say to his father, and ust as he said it
I caught a faint sound of someone moving in the branches above me.

o he hasnt I shouted. es up this tree.

I believe the dogs found him, dad

Yes, hes up here. Come along and meet him.

red came to the foot of the tree.

You up there, he said, come along down.

ot a sound from the tree.

Its all right, I explained, he is up there, but hes very shy. Ask
him again.

All right, said red. tay there if you want to. ut Im going to
shoot off this gun into the branches ust for fun.

And then the man started to come down. As soon as he touched the ground
I umped up at him.

his is fine I said eres my friend red. Youll like him.

ut it wasnt any good. hey didnt get along together at all. hey
hardly spoke. he man went into the house, and red went after him,
carrying his gun. And when they got into the house it was ust the
same. he man sat in one chair, and red sat in another, and after a
long time some men came in a motorcar, and the man went away with
them. e didnt say goodbye to me.

When he had gone, red and his father made a great fuss of me. I
couldnt understand it. Men are so odd. he man wasnt a bit pleased
that I had brought him and red together, but red seemed as if he
couldnt do enough for me for having introduced him to the man.
owever, reds father produced some cold hammy favourite dishand
gave me uite a lot of it, so I stopped worrying over the thing. As
mother used to say, ont bother your head about what doesnt concern
you. he only thing a dog need concern himself with is the
billoffare. at your bun, and dont make yourself busy about other
peoples affairs. Mothers was in some ways a narrow outlook, but she
had a great fund of sterling common sense.



II. e Moves in ociety

It was one of those things which are really nobodys fault. It was not
the chauffeurs fault, and it was not mine. I was having a friendly
turnup with a pal of mine on the sidewalk he ran across the road I
ran after him and the car came round the corner and hit me. It must
have been going pretty slow, or I should have been killed. As it was, I
ust had the breath knocked out of me. You know how you feel when the
butcher catches you ust as you are edging out of the shop with a bit
of meat. It was like that.

I wasnt taking much interest in things for awhile, but when I did I
found that I was the centre of a group of threethe chauffeur, a small
boy, and the small boys nurse.

he small boy was very welldressed, and looked delicate. e was
crying.

oor doggie, he said, poor doggie.

It wasnt my fault, Master eter, said the chauffeur respectfully.
e run out into the road before I seen him.

hats right, I put in, for I didnt want to get the man into
trouble.

h, hes not dead, said the small boy. e barked.

e growled, said the nurse. Come away, Master eter. e might bite
you.

Women are trying sometimes. It is almost as if they deliberately
misunderstood.

I wont come away. Im going to take him home with me and send for the
doctor to come and see him. es going to be my dog.

his sounded all right. Goodness knows I am no snob, and can rough it
when reuired, but I do like comfort when it comes my way, and it
seemed to me that this was where I got it. And I liked the boy. e was
the right sort.

he nurse, a very unpleasant woman, had to make obections.

Master eter You cant take him home, a great, rough, fierce, common
dog What would your mother say

Im going to take him home, repeated the child, with a determination
which I heartily admired, and hes going to be my dog. I shall call
him ido.

heres always a catch in these good things. ido is a name I
particularly detest. All dogs do. here was a dog called that that I
knew once, and he used to get awfully sick when we shouted it out after
him in the street. o doubt there have been respectable dogs called
ido, but to my mind it is a name like Aubrey or Clarence. You may be
able to live it down, but you start handicapped. owever, one must take
the rough with the smooth, and I was prepared to yield the point.

If you wait, Master eter, your father will buy you a beautiful,
lovely dog....

I dont want a beautiful, lovely dog. I want this dog.

he slur did not wound me. I have no illusions about my looks. Mine is
an honest, but not a beautiful, face.

Its no use talking, said the chauffeur, grinning. e means to have
him. hove him in, and lets be getting back, or theyll be thinking
is ibs has been kidnapped.

o I was carried to the car. I could have walked, but I had an idea
that I had better not. I had made my hit as a crippled dog, and a
crippled dog I intended to remain till things got more settled down.

he chauffeur started the car off again. What with the shock I had had
and the luxury of riding in a motorcar, I was a little distrait, and I
could not say how far we went. ut it must have been miles and miles,
for it seemed a long time afterwards that we stopped at the biggest
house I have ever seen. here were smooth lawns and flowerbeds, and
men in overalls, and fountains and trees, and, away to the right,
kennels with about a million dogs in them, all pushing their noses
through the bars and shouting. hey all wanted to know who I was and
what prizes I had won, and then I realized that I was moving in high
society.

I let the small boy pick me up and carry me into the house, though it
was all he could do, poor kid, for I was some weight. e staggered up
the steps and along a great hall, and then let me flop on the carpet of
the most beautiful room you ever saw. he carpet was a yard thick.

here was a woman sitting in a chair, and as soon as she saw me she
gave a shriek.

I told Master eter you would not be pleased, mlady, said the nurse,
who seemed to have taken a positive dislike to me, but he would bring
the nasty brute home.

es not a nasty brute, mother. es my dog, and his names ido. ohn
ran over him in the car, and I brought him home to live with us. I love
him.

his seemed to make an impression. eters mother looked as if she were
weakening.

ut, eter, dear, I dont know what your father will say. es so
particular about dogs. All his dogs are prizewinners, pedigree dogs.
his is such a mongrel.

A nasty, rough, ugly, common dog, mlady, said the nurse, sticking
her oar in in an absolutely uncalledfor way.

ust then a man came into the room.

What on earth he said, catching sight of me.

Its a dog eter has brought home. e says he wants to keep him.

Im going to keep him, corrected eter firmly.

I do like a child that knows his own mind. I was getting fonder of
eter every minute. I reached up and licked his hand.

ee e knows hes my dog, dont you, ido e licked me.

ut, eter, he looks so fierce. his, unfortunately, is true. I do
look fierce. It is rather a misfortune for a perfectly peaceful dog.
Im sure its not safe your having him.

es my dog, and his names ido. I am going to tell cook to give him
a bone.

is mother looked at his father, who gave rather a nasty laugh.

My dear elen, he said, ever since eter was born, ten years ago, he
has not asked for a single thing, to the best of my recollection, which
he has not got. et us be consistent. I dont approve of this
caricature of a dog, but if eter wants him, I suppose he must have
him.

ery well. ut the first sign of viciousness he shows, he shall be
shot. e makes me nervous.

o they left it at that, and I went off with eter to get my bone.

After lunch, he took me to the kennels to introduce me to the other
dogs. I had to go, but I knew it would not be pleasant, and it wasnt.
Any dog will tell you what these prizeribbon dogs are like. heir
heads are so swelled they have to go into their kennels backwards.

It was ust as I had expected. here were mastiffs, terriers, poodles,
spaniels, bulldogs, sheepdogs, and every other kind of dog you can
imagine, all prizewinners at a hundred shows, and every single dog in
the place ust shoved his head back and laughed himself sick. I never
felt so small in my life, and I was glad when it was over and eter
took me off to the stables.

I was ust feeling that I never wanted to see another dog in my life,
when a terrier ran out, shouting. As soon as he saw me, he came up
inuiringly, walking very stifflegged, as terriers do when they see a
stranger.

Well, I said, and what particular sort of a prizewinner are you
ell me all about the ribbons they gave you at the Crystal alace, and
lets get it over.

e laughed in a way that did me good.

Guess again he said. id you take me for one of the nuts in the
kennels My names ack, and I belong to one of the grooms.

What I cried. You arent Champion owlegs oyal or anything of that
sort Im glad to meet you.

o we rubbed noses as friendly as you please. It was a treat meeting
one of ones own sort. I had had enough of those hightoned dogs who
look at you as if you were something the garbageman had forgotten to
take away.

o youve been talking to the swells, have you said ack.

e would take me, I said, pointing to eter.

h, youre his latest, are you hen youre all rightwhile it
lasts.

ow do you mean, while it lasts

Well, Ill tell you what happened to me. Young eter took a great
fancy to me once. Couldnt do enough for me for a while. hen he got
tired of me, and out I went. You see, the trouble is that while hes a
perfectly good kid, he has always had everything he wanted since he was
born, and he gets tired of things pretty easy. It was a toy railway
that finished me. irectly he got that, I might not have been on the
earth. It was lucky for me that ick, my present old man, happened to
want a dog to keep down the rats, or goodness knows what might not have
happened to me. hey arent keen on dogs here unless theyve pulled
down enough blue ribbons to sink a ship, and mongrels like you and
meno offencedont last long. I expect you noticed that the
grownups didnt exactly cheer when you arrived

hey werent chummy.

Well take it from me, your only chance is to make them chummy. If you
do something to please them, they might let you stay on, even though
eter was tired of you.

What sort of thing

hats for you to think out. I couldnt find one. I might tell you to
save eter from drowning. You dont need a pedigree to do that. ut you
cant drag the kid to the lake and push him in. hats the trouble. A
dog gets so few opportunities. ut, take it from me, if you dont do
something within two weeks to make yourself solid with the adults, you
can make your will. In two weeks eter will have forgotten all about
you. Its not his fault. Its the way he has been brought up. is
father has all the money on earth, and eters the only child. You
cant blame him. All I say is, look out for yourself. Well, Im glad to
have met you. rop in again when you can. I can give you some good
ratting, and I have a bone or two put away. o long.

                                   

It worried me badly what ack had said. I couldnt get it out of my
mind. If it hadnt been for that, I should have had a great time, for
eter certainly made a lot of fuss of me. e treated me as if I were
the only friend he had.

And, in a way, I was. When you are the only son of a man who has all
the money in the world, it seems that you arent allowed to be like an
ordinary kid. hey coop you up, as if you were something precious that
would be contaminated by contact with other children. In all the time
that I was at the house I never met another child. eter had everything
in the world, except someone of his own age to go round with and that
made him different from any of the kids I had known.

e liked talking to me. I was the only person round who really
understood him. e would talk by the hour and I would listen with my
tongue hanging out and nod now and then.

It was worth listening to, what he used to tell me. e told me the most
surprising things. I didnt know, for instance, that there were any ed
Indians in ngland but he said there was a chief named ig Cloud who
lived in the rhododendron bushes by the lake. I never found him, though
I went carefully through them one day. e also said that there were
pirates on the island in the lake. I never saw them either.

What he liked telling me about best was the city of gold and precious
stones which you came to if you walked far enough through the woods at
the back of the stables. e was always meaning to go off there some
day, and, from the way he described it, I didnt blame him. It was
certainly a pretty good city. It was ust right for dogs, too, he said,
having bones and liver and sweet cakes there and everything else a dog
could want. It used to make my mouth water to listen to him.

We were never apart. I was with him all day, and I slept on the mat in
his room at night. ut all the time I couldnt get out of my mind what
ack had said. I nearly did once, for it seemed to me that I was so
necessary to eter that nothing could separate us but ust as I was
feeling safe his father gave him a toy aeroplane, which flew when you
wound it up. he day he got it, I might not have been on the earth. I
trailed along, but he hadnt a word to say to me.

Well, something went wrong with the aeroplane the second day, and it
wouldnt fly, and then I was in solid again but I had done some hard
thinking and I knew ust where I stood. I was the newest toy, thats
what I was, and something newer might come along at any moment, and
then it would be the finish for me. he only thing for me was to do
something to impress the adults, ust as ack had said.

Goodness knows I tried. ut everything I did turned out wrong. here
seemed to be a fate about it. ne morning, for example, I was trotting
round the house early, and I met a fellow I could have sworn was a
burglar. e wasnt one of the family, and he wasnt one of the
servants, and he was hanging round the house in a most suspicious way.
I chased him up a tree, and it wasnt till the family came down to
breakfast, two hours later, that I found that he was a guest who had
arrived overnight, and had come out early to enoy the freshness of the
morning and the sun shining on the lake, he being that sort of man.
hat didnt help me much.

ext, I got in wrong with the boss, eters father. I dont know why. I
met him out in the park with another man, both carrying bundles of
sticks and looking very serious and earnest. ust as I reached him, the
boss lifted one of the sticks and hit a small white ball with it. e
had never seemed to want to play with me before, and I took it as a
great compliment. I raced after the ball, which he had hit uite a long
way, picked it up in my mouth, and brought it back to him. I laid it at
his feet, and smiled up at him.

it it again, I said.

e wasnt pleased at all. e said all sorts of things and tried to kick
me, and that night, when he thought I was not listening, I heard him
telling his wife that I was a pest and would have to be got rid of.
hat made me think.

And then I put the lid on it. With the best intentions in the world I
got myself into such a mess that I thought the end had come.

It happened one afternoon in the drawingroom. here were visitors that
daywomen and women seem fatal to me. I was in the background, trying
not to be seen, for, though I had been brought in by eter, the family
never liked my coming into the drawingroom. I was hoping for a piece
of cake and not paying much attention to the conversation, which was
all about somebody called oto, whom I had not met. eters mother said
oto was a sweet little darling, he was and one of the visitors said
oto had not been at all himself that day and she was uite worried.
And a good lot more about how all that oto would ever take for dinner
was a little white meat of chicken, chopped up fine. It was not very
interesting, and I had allowed my attention to wander.

And ust then, peeping round the corner of my chair to see if there
were any signs of cake, what should I see but a great beastly brute of
a rat. It was standing right beside the visitor, drinking milk out of a
saucer, if you please

I may have my faults, but procrastination in the presence of rats is
not one of them. I didnt hesitate for a second. ere was my chance. If
there is one thing women hate, it is a rat. Mother always used to say,
If you want to succeed in life, please the women. hey are the real
bosses. he men dont count. y eliminating this rodent I should earn
the gratitude and esteem of eters mother, and, if I did that, it did
not matter what eters father thought of me.

I sprang.

he rat hadnt a chance to get away. I was right on to him. I got hold
of his neck, gave him a couple of shakes, and chucked him across the
room. hen I ran across to finish him off.

ust as I reached him, he sat up and barked at me. I was never so taken
aback in my life. I pulled up short and stared at him.

Im sure I beg your pardon, sir, I said apologetically. I thought
you were a rat.

And then everything broke loose. omebody got me by the collar,
somebody else hit me on the head with a parasol, and somebody else
kicked me in the ribs. verybody talked and shouted at the same time.

oor darling oto cried the visitor, snatching up the little animal.
id the great savage brute try to murder you

o absolutely unprovoked

e ust flew at the poor little thing

It was no good my trying to explain. Any dog in my place would have
made the same mistake. he creature was a toydog of one of those
extraordinary breedsa prizewinner and champion, and so on, of
course, and worth his weight in gold. I would have done better to bite
the visitor than oto. hat much I gathered from the general run of the
conversation, and then, having discovered that the door was shut, I
edged under the sofa. I was embarrassed.

hat settles it said eters mother. he dog is not safe. e must
be shot.

eter gave a yell at this, but for once he didnt swing the voting an
inch.

e uiet, eter, said his mother. It is not safe for you to have
such a dog. e may be mad.

Women are very unreasonable.

oto, of course, wouldnt say a word to explain how the mistake arose.
e was sitting on the visitors lap, shrieking about what he would have
done to me if they hadnt separated us.

omebody felt cautiously under the sofa. I recognized the shoes of
Weeks, the butler. I suppose they had rung for him to come and take me,
and I could see that he wasnt half liking it. I was sorry for Weeks,
who was a friend of mine, so I licked his hand, and that seemed to
cheer him up a whole lot.

I have him now, madam, I heard him say.

ake him to the stables and tie him up, Weeks, and tell one of the men
to bring his gun and shoot him. e is not safe.

A few minutes later I was in an empty stall, tied up to the manger.

It was all over. It had been pleasant while it lasted, but I had
reached the end of my tether now. I dont think I was frightened, but a
sense of pathos stole over me. I had meant so well. It seemed as if
good intentions went for nothing in this world. I had tried so hard to
please everybody, and this was the resulttied up in a dark stable,
waiting for the end.

he shadows lengthened in the stableyard, and still nobody came. I
began to wonder if they had forgotten me, and presently, in spite of
myself, a faint hope began to spring up inside me that this might mean
that I was not to be shot after all. erhaps oto at the eleventh hour
had explained everything.

And then footsteps sounded outside, and the hope died away. I shut my
eyes.

omebody put his arms round my neck, and my nose touched a warm cheek.
I opened my eyes. It was not the man with the gun come to shoot me. It
was eter. e was breathing very hard, and he had been crying.

uiet he whispered.

e began to untie the rope.

You must keep uite uiet, or they will hear us, and then we shall be
stopped. Im going to take you into the woods, and well walk and walk
until we come to the city I told you about thats all gold and
diamonds, and well live there for the rest of our lives, and no one
will be able to hurt us. ut you must keep very uiet.

e went to the stablegate and looked out. hen he gave a little
whistle to me to come after him. And we started out to find the city.

he woods were a long way away, down a hill of long grass and across a
stream and we went very carefully, keeping in the shadows and running
across the open spaces. And every now and then we would stop and look
back, but there was nobody to be seen. he sun was setting, and
everything was very cool and uiet.

resently we came to the stream and crossed it by a little wooden
bridge, and then we were in the woods, where nobody could see us.

I had never been in the woods before, and everything was very new and
exciting to me. here were suirrels and rabbits and birds, more than I
had ever seen in my life, and little things that buzzed and flew and
tickled my ears. I wanted to rush about and look at everything, but
eter called to me, and I came to heel. e knew where we were going,
and I didnt, so I let him lead.

We went very slowly. he wood got thicker and thicker the farther we
got into it. here were bushes that were difficult to push through, and
long branches, covered with thorns, that reached out at you and tore at
you when you tried to get away. And soon it was uite dark, so dark
that I could see nothing, not even eter, though he was so close. We
went slower and slower, and the darkness was full of ueer noises. rom
time to time eter would stop, and I would run to him and put my nose
in his hand. At first he patted me, but after a while he did not pat me
any more, but ust gave me his hand to lick, as if it was too much for
him to lift it. I think he was getting very tired. e was uite a small
boy and not strong, and we had walked a long way.

It seemed to be getting darker and darker. I could hear the sound of
eters footsteps, and they seemed to drag as he forced his way through
the bushes. And then, uite suddenly, he sat down without any warning,
and when I ran up I heard him crying.

I suppose there are lots of dogs who would have known exactly the right
thing to do, but I could not think of anything except to put my nose
against his cheek and whine. e put his arm round my neck, and for a
long time we stayed like that, saying nothing. It seemed to comfort
him, for after a time he stopped crying.

I did not bother him by asking about the wonderful city where we were
going, for he was so tired. ut I could not help wondering if we were
near it. here was not a sign of any city, nothing but darkness and odd
noises and the wind singing in the trees. Curious little animals, such
as I had never smelt before, came creeping out of the bushes to look at
us. I would have chased them, but eters arm was round my neck and I
could not leave him. ut when something that smelt like a rabbit came
so near that I could have reached out a paw and touched it, I turned my
head and snapped and then they all scurried back into the bushes and
there were no more noises.

here was a long silence. hen eter gave a great gulp.

Im not frightened, he said. Im not

I shoved my head closer against his chest. here was another silence
for a long time.

Im going to pretend we have been captured by brigands, said eter at
last. Are you listening here were three of them, great big men with
beards, and they crept up behind me and snatched me up and took me out
here to their lair. his is their lair. ne was called ick, the
others names were ed and Alfred. hey took hold of me and brought me
all the way through the wood till we got here, and then they went off,
meaning to come back soon. And while they were away, you missed me and
tracked me through the woods till you found me here. And then the
brigands came back, and they didnt know you were here, and you kept
uite uiet till ick was uite near, and then you umped out and bit
him and he ran away. And then you bit ed and you bit Alfred, and they
ran away too. And so we were left all alone, and I was uite safe
because you were here to look after me. And thenAnd then

is voice died away, and the arm that was round my neck went limp, and
I could hear by his breathing that he was asleep. is head was resting
on my back, but I didnt move. I wriggled a little closer to make him
as comfortable as I could, and then I went to sleep myself.

I didnt sleep very well. I had funny dreams all the time, thinking
these little animals were creeping up close enough out of the bushes
for me to get a snap at them without disturbing eter.

If I woke once, I woke a dozen times, but there was never anything
there. he wind sang in the trees and the bushes rustled, and far away
in the distance the frogs were calling.

And then I woke once more with the feeling that this time something
really was coming through the bushes. I lifted my head as far as I
could, and listened. or a little while nothing happened, and then,
straight in front of me, I saw lights. And there was a sound of
trampling in the undergrowth.

It was no time to think about not waking eter. his was something
definite, something that had to be attended to uick. I was up with a
ump, yelling. eter rolled off my back and woke up, and he sat there
listening, while I stood with my front paws on him and shouted at the
men. I was bristling all over. I didnt know who they were or what they
wanted, but the way I looked at it was that anything could happen in
those woods at that time of night, and, if anybody was coming along to
start something, he had got to reckon with me.

omebody called, eter Are you there, eter

here was a crashing in the bushes, the lights came nearer and nearer,
and then somebody said ere he is and there was a lot of shouting. I
stood where I was, ready to spring if necessary, for I was taking no
chances.

Who are you I shouted. What do you want A light flashed in my
eyes.

Why, its that dog

omebody came into the light, and I saw it was the boss. e was looking
very anxious and scared, and he scooped eter up off the ground and
hugged him tight.

eter was only half awake. e looked up at the boss drowsily, and began
to talk about brigands, and ick and ed and Alfred, the same as he had
said to me. here wasnt a sound till he had finished. hen the boss
spoke.

idnappers I thought as much. And the dog drove them away

or the first time in our acuaintance he actually patted me.

Good old man he said.

es my dog, said eter sleepily, and he isnt to be shot.

e certainly isnt, my boy, said the boss. rom now on hes the
honoured guest. e shall wear a gold collar and order what he wants for
dinner. And now lets be getting home. Its time you were in bed.

                                   

Mother used to say, If youre a good dog, you will be happy. If youre
not, you wont, but it seems to me that in this world it is all a
matter of luck. When I did everything I could to please people, they
wanted to shoot me and when I did nothing except run away, they
brought me back and treated me better than the most valuable
prizewinner in the kennels. It was puzzling at first, but one day I
heard the boss talking to a friend who had come down from the city.

he friend looked at me and said, What an ugly mongrel Why on earth
do you have him about I thought you were so particular about your
dogs

And the boss replied, e may be a mongrel, but he can have anything he
wants in this house. idnt you hear how he saved eter from being
kidnapped

And out it all came about the brigands.

he kid called them brigands, said the boss. I suppose thats how it
would strike a child of that age. ut he kept mentioning the name ick,
and that put the police on the scent. It seems theres a kidnapper well
known to the police all over the country as ick the natcher. It was
almost certainly that scoundrel and his gang. ow they spirited the
child away, goodness knows, but they managed it, and the dog tracked
them and scared them off. We found him and eter together in the woods.
It was a narrow escape, and we have to thank this animal here for it.

What could I say It was no more use trying to put them right than it
had been when I mistook oto for a rat. eter had gone to sleep that
night pretending about the brigands to pass the time, and when he awoke
he still believed in them. e was that sort of child. here was nothing
that I could do about it.

ound the corner, as the boss was speaking, I saw the kennelman coming
with a plate in his hand. It smelt fine, and he was headed straight for
me.

e put the plate down before me. It was liver, which I love.

Yes, went on the boss, if it hadnt been for him, eter would have
been kidnapped and scared half to death, and I should be poorer, I
suppose, by whatever the scoundrels had chosen to hold me up for.

I am an honest dog, and hate to obtain credit under false pretences,
butliver is liver. I let it go at that.




CW A


atie had never been more surprised in her life than when the serious
young man with the brown eyes and the Charles ana Gibson profile
spirited her away from his friend and Genevieve. ill that moment she
had looked on herself as playing a sort of villager and retainer part
to the browneyed young mans hero and Genevieves heroine. he knew
she was not pretty, though somebody unidentified had once said that
she had nice eyes whereas Genevieve was notoriously a beauty,
incessantly pestered, so report had it, by musical comedy managers to
go on the stage.

Genevieve was tall and blonde, a destroyer of masculine peace of mind.
he said harf and rahther, and might easily have been taken for an
nglish duchess instead of a cloakmodel at Maceys. You would have
said, in short, that, in the matter of personable young men, Genevieve
would have swept the board. Yet, here was this one deliberately
selecting her, atie, for his companion. It was almost a miracle.

e had managed it with the utmost dexterity at the merrygoround. With
winning politeness he had assisted Genevieve on her wooden steed, and
then, as the machinery began to work, had grasped aties arm and led
her at a rapid walk out into the sunlight. aties last glimpse of
Genevieve had been the sight of her amazed and offended face as it
whizzed round the corner, while the steam melodeon drowned protests
with a spirited plunge into Alexanders agtime and.

atie felt shy. his young man was a perfect stranger. It was true she
had had a formal introduction to him, but only from Genevieve, who had
scraped acuaintance with him exactly two minutes previously. It had
happened on the ferryboat on the way to alisades ark. Genevieves
bright eye, roving among the throng on the lower deck, had singled out
this young man and his companion as suitable cavaliers for the
expedition. he young man pleased her, and his friend, with the broken
nose and the face like a goodnatured bulldog, was obviously suitable
for atie.

tiuette is not rigid on ew York ferryboats. Without fuss or delay
she proceeded to make their acuaintanceto aties concern, for she
could never get used to Genevieves short way with strangers. he uiet
life she had led had made her almost prudish, and there were times when
Genevieves conduct shocked her. f course, she knew there was no harm
in Genevieve. As the latter herself had once put it, he feller that
tries to get gay with me is going to get a calldown thatll make him
holler for his winter overcoat. ut all the same she could not
approve. And the net result of her disapproval was to make her shy and
silent as she walked by this young mans side.

he young man seemed to divine her thoughts.

ay, Im on the level, he observed. You want to get that. ight on
the suare. ee

h, yes, said atie, relieved but yet embarrassed. It was awkward to
have ones thoughts read like this.

You aint like your friend. ont think I dont see that.

Genevieves a sweet girl, said atie, loyally.

A darned sight too sweet. omebody ought to tell her mother.

Why did you speak to her if you did not like her

Wanted to get to know you, said the young man simply.

hey walked on in silence. aties heart was beating with a rapidity
that forbade speech. othing like this very direct young man had ever
happened to her before. he had grown so accustomed to regarding
herself as something too insignificant and unattractive for the notice
of the lordly male that she was overwhelmed. he had a vague feeling
that there was a mistake somewhere. It surely could not be she who was
proving so alluring to this fairy prince. he novelty of the situation
frightened her.

Come here often asked her companion.

Ive never been here before.

ften go to Coney

Ive never been.

e regarded her with astonishment.

Youve never been to Coney Island Why, you dont know what this sort
of thing is till youve taken in Coney. his place isnt on the map
with Coney. o you mean to say youve never seen una ark, or
reamland, or teeplechase, or the diving ducks avent you had a look
at the Mardi Gras stunts Why, Coney during Mardi Gras is the greatest
thing on earth. Its a knockout. ust about a million boys and girls
having the best time that ever was. ay, I guess you dont go out much,
do you

ot much.

If its not a rude uestion, what do you do I been trying to place you
all along. ow I reckon your friend works in a store, dont she

Yes. hes a cloakmodel. he has a lovely figure, hasnt she

idnt notice it. I guess so, if shes what you say. Its what they
pay her for, aint it o you work in a store, too

ot exactly. I keep a little shop.

All by yourself

I do all the work now. It was my fathers shop, but hes dead. It
began by being my grandfathers. e started it. ut hes so old now
that, of course, he cant work any longer, so I look after things.

ay, youre a wonder What sort of a shop

Its only a little secondhand bookshop. here really isnt much to
do.

Where is it

ixth Avenue. ear Washington uare.

What name

ennett.

hats your name, then

Yes.

Anything besides ennett

My names ate.

he young man nodded.

Id make a pretty good district attorney, he said, disarming possible
resentment at this crossexamination. I guess youre wondering if Im
ever going to stop asking you uestions. Well, what would you like to
do

ont you think we ought to go back and find your friend and
Genevieve hey will be wondering where we are.

et em, said the young man briefly. Ive had all I want of enny.

I cant understand why you dont like her.

I like you. hall we have some icecream, or would you rather go on
the cenic ailway

atie decided on the more peaceful pleasure. hey resumed their walk,
socially licking two cones. ut of the corner of her eyes atie cast
swift glances at her friends face. e was a very grave young man.
here was something important as well as handsome about him. nce, as
they made their way through the crowds, she saw a couple of boys look
almost reverently at him. he wondered who he could be, but was too shy
to inuire. he had got over her nervousness to a great extent, but
there were still limits to what she felt herself eual to saying. It
did not strike her that it was only fair that she should ask a few
uestions in return for those which he had put. he had always
repressed herself, and she did so now. he was content to be with him
without finding out his name and history.

e supplied the former ust before he finally consented to let her go.

hey were standing looking over the river. he sun had spent its force,
and it was cool and pleasant in the breeze which was coming up the
udson. atie was conscious of a vague feeling that was almost
melancholy. It had been a lovely afternoon, and she was sorry that it
was over.

he young man shuffled his feet on the loose stones.

Im mighty glad I met you, he said. ay, Im coming to see you. n
ixth Avenue. ont mind, do you

e did not wait for a reply.

radys my name. ed rady, Glencoe Athletic Club, he paused. Im on
the level, he added, and paused again. I like you a whole lot. heres
your friend, Genevieve. etter go after her, hadnt you Goodbye. And
he was gone, walking swiftly through the crowd about the bandstand.

atie went back to Genevieve, and Genevieve was simply horrid. Cold and
haughty, a beautiful iceberg of dudgeon, she refused to speak a single
word during the whole long ourney back to ixth Avenue. And atie,
whose tender heart would at other times have been tortured by this
hostility, leant back in her seat, and was happy. er mind was far away
from Genevieves frozen gloom, living over again the wonderful
happenings of the afternoon.

Yes, it had been a wonderful afternoon, but trouble was waiting for her
in ixth Avenue. rouble was never absent for very long from aties
unselfish life. Arriving at the little bookshop, she found Mr Murdoch,
the glazier, preparing for departure. Mr Murdoch came in on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and ridays to play draughts with her grandfather, who was
paralysed from the waist, and unable to leave the house except when
atie took him for his outing in Washington uare each morning in his
bathchair.

Mr Murdoch welcomed atie with oy.

I was wondering whenever you would come back, atie. Im afraid the
old mans a little upset.

ot ill

ot ill. pset. And it was my fault, too. hinking hed be interested,
I read him a piece from the paper where I seen about these nglish
uffragettes, and he ust went up in the air. I guess hell be all
right now youve come back. I was a fool to read it, I reckon. I kind
of forgot for the moment.

lease dont worry yourself about it, Mr Murdoch. ell be all right
soon. Ill go to him.

In the inner room the old man was sitting. is face was flushed, and he
gesticulated from time to time.

I wont have it, he cried as atie entered. I tell you I wont have
it. If arliament cant do anything, Ill send arliament about its
business.

ere I am, grandpapa, said atie uickly. Ive had the greatest
time. It was lovely up there. I

I tell you its got to stop. Ive spoken about it before. I wont have
it.

I expect theyre doing their best. Its your being so far away that
makes it hard for them. ut I do think you might write them a very
sharp letter.

I will. I will. Get out the paper. Are you ready e stopped, and
looked piteously at atie. I dont know what to say. I dont know how
to begin.

atie scribbled a few lines.

ow would this do is Maesty informs his Government that he is
greatly surprised and indignant that no notice has been taken of his
previous communications. If this goes on, he will be reluctantly
compelled to put the matter in other hands.

he read it glibly as she had written it. he formula had been a
favourite one of her late father, when roused to fall upon offending
patrons of the bookshop.

he old man beamed. is resentment was gone. e was soothed and happy.

hatll wake em up, he said. I wont have these goings on while Im
king, and if they dont like it, they know what to do. Youre a good
girl, atie.

e chuckled.

I beat ord Murdoch five games to nothing, he said.

It was now nearly two years since the morning when old Matthew ennett
had announced to an audience consisting of atie and a smoky blue cat,
which had wandered in from Washington uare to take potluck, that he
was the ing of ngland.

his was a long time for any one delusion of the old mans to last.
sually they came and went with a rapidity which made it hard for
atie, for all her tact, to keep abreast of them. he was not likely to
forget the time when he went to bed resident oosevelt and woke up the
rophet liah. It was the only occasion in all the years they had
passed together when she had felt like giving way and indulging in the
fit of hysterics which most girls of her age would have had as a matter
of course.

he had handled that crisis, and she handled the present one with eual
smoothness. When her grandfather made his announcement, which he did
rather as one stating a generally recognized fact than as if the
information were in any way sensational, she neither screamed nor
swooned, nor did she rush to the neighbours for advice. he merely gave
the old man his breakfast, not forgetting to set aside a suitable
portion for the smoky cat, and then went round to notify Mr Murdoch of
what had happened.

Mr Murdoch, excellent man, received the news without any fuss or
excitement at all, and promised to look in on chwartz, the stout
saloonkeeper, who was Mr ennetts companion and antagonist at
draughts on uesdays, hursdays, and aturdays, and, as he expressed
it, put him wise.

ife ran comfortably in the new groove. ld Mr ennett continued to
play draughts and pore over his secondhand classics. very morning he
took his outing in Washington uare where, from his invalids chair,
he surveyed somnolent Italians and rollerskating children with his old
air of kindly approval. atie, whom circumstances had taught to be
thankful for small mercies, was perfectly happy in the shadow of the
throne. he liked her work she liked looking after her grandfather
and now that ed rady had come into her life, she really began to look
on herself as an exceptionally lucky girl, a spoilt favourite of
ortune.

or ed rady had called, as he said he would, and from the very first
he had made plain in his grave, direct way the obects of his visits.
here was no subtlety about ed, no finesse. e was as frank as a
musichall love song.

n his first visit, having handed atie a large bunch of roses with the
stolidity of a messenger boy handing over a parcel, he had proceeded,
by way of establishing his bona fides, to tell her all about
himself. e supplied the facts in no settled order, ust as they
happened to occur to him in the long silences with which his speech was
punctuated. mall facts ostled large facts. e spoke of his morals and
his foxterrier in the same breath.

Im on the level. Ask anyone who knows me. heyll tell you that. ay,
I got the cutest little dog you ever seen. o you like dogs Ive never
been a fellow thats got himself mixed up with girls. I dont like em
as a general thing. A fellows got too much to do keeping himself in
training, if his club expects him to do things. I belong to the Glencoe
Athletic. I ran the hundred yards dash in evens last sports there was.
hey expect me to do it at the Glencoe, so Ive never got myself mixed
up with girls. ill I seen you that afternoon I reckon Id hardly
looked at a girl, honest. hey didnt seem to kind of make any hit with
me. And then I seen you, and I says to myself, hats the one. It
sort of came over me in a flash. I fell for you directly I seen you.
And Im on the level. ont forget that.

And more in the same strain, leaning on the counter and looking into
aties eyes with a devotion that added emphasis to his measured
speech.

ext day he came again, and kissed her respectfully but firmly, making
a sort of shuffling dive across the counter. reaking away, he fumbled
in his pocket and produced a ring, which he proceeded to place on her
finger with the serious air which accompanied all his actions.

hat looks pretty good to me, he said, as he stepped back and eyed
it.

It struck atie, when he had gone, how differently different men did
things. Genevieve had often related stories of men who had proposed to
her, and according to Genevieve, they always got excited and emotional,
and sometimes cried. ed rady had fitted her with the ring more like a
glovers assistant than anything else, and he had hardly spoken a word
from beginning to end. e had seemed to take her acuiescence for
granted. And yet there had been nothing flat or disappointing about the
proceedings. he had been thrilled throughout. It is to be supposed
that Mr rady had the force of character which does not reuire the aid
of speech.

It was not till she took the news of her engagement to old Mr ennett
that it was borne in upon atie that ate did not intend to be so
wholly benevolent to her as she supposed.

hat her grandfather could offer any opposition had not occurred to her
as a possibility. he took his approval for granted. ever, as long as
she could remember, had he been anything but kind to her. And the only
possible obections to marriage from a grandfathers point of
viewbadness of character, insufficient means, or inferiority of
social positionwere in this case gloriously absent.

he could not see how anyone, however hypercritical, could find a flaw
in ed. is character was spotless. e was comfortably off. And so far
from being in any way inferior socially, it was he who condescended.
or ed, she had discovered from conversation with Mr Murdoch, the
glazier, was no ordinary young man. e was a celebrity. o much so that
for a moment, when told the news of the engagement, Mr Murdoch,
startled out of his usual tact, had exhibited frank surprise that the
great ed rady should not have aimed higher.

Youre sure youve got the name right, atie he had said. Its
really ed rady o mistake about the first name Wellbuilt,
goodlooking young chap with brown eyes Well, this beats me. ot, he
went on hurriedly, that any young fellow mightnt think himself lucky
to get a wife like you, atie, but ed rady Why, there isnt a girl
in this part of the town, or in arlem or the ronx, for that matter,
who wouldnt give her eyes to be in your place. Why, ed rady is the
big noise. es the star of the Glencoe.

e told me he belonged to the Glencoe Athletic.

ont you believe it. It belongs to him. Why, the way that boy runs
and umps is the real limit. heres only illy urton, of the
IrishAmerican, that can touch him. Youve certainly got the pick of
the bunch, atie.

e stared at her admiringly, as if for the first time realizing her
true worth. or Mr Murdoch was a great patron of sport.

With these facts in her possession atie had approached the interview
with her grandfather with a good deal of confidence.

he old man listened to her recital of Mr radys ualities in silence.
hen he shook his head.

It cant be, atie. I couldnt have it.

Grandpapa

Youre forgetting, my dear.

orgetting

Who ever heard of such a thing he granddaughter of the ing of
ngland marrying a commoner It wouldnt do at all.

Consternation, surprise, and misery kept atie dumb. he had learned in
a hard school to be prepared for sudden blows from the hand of fate,
but this one was so entirely unforeseen that it found her unprepared,
and she was crushed by it. he knew her grandfathers obstinacy too
well to argue against the decision.

h, no, not at all, he repeated. h, no, it wouldnt do.

atie said nothing she was beyond speech. he stood there wideeyed
and silent among the ruins of her little aircastle. he old man patted
her hand affectionately. e was pleased at her docility. It was the
right attitude, becoming in one of her high rank.

I am very sorry, my dear, butoh, no oh, no oh, no is voice
trailed away into an unintelligible mutter. e was a very old man, and
he was not always able to concentrate his thoughts on a subect for any
length of time.

o little did ed rady realize at first the true complexity of the
situation that he was inclined, when he heard of the news, to treat the
crisis in the aunty, dashing, lovelaughsatlocksmith fashion so
popular with young men of spirit when thwarted in their loves by the
interference of parents and guardians.

It took atie some time to convince him that, ust because he had the
licence in his pocket, he could not snatch her up on his saddlebow and
carry her off to the nearest clergyman after the manner of young
ochinvar.

In the first flush of his resentment at restraint he saw no reason why
he should differentiate between old Mr ennett and the conventional
bannsforbidding father of the novelettes with which he was accustomed
to sweeten his hours of idleness. o him, till atie explained the
intricacies of the position, Mr ennett was simply the proud
millionaire who would not hear of his daughter marrying the artist.

ut, ed, dear, you dont understand, atie said. We simply couldnt
do that. heres no one but me to look after him, poor old man. ow
could I run away like that and get married What would become of him

You wouldnt be away long, urged Mr rady, a man of many parts, but
not a rapid thinker. he minister would have us fixed up inside of
half an hour. hen wed look in at Mouuins for a steak and fried,
ust to make a sort of wedding breakfast. And then back wed come,
handinhand, and say, Well, here we are. ow what

e would never forgive me.

hat, said ed udicially, would be up to him.

It would kill him. ont you see, we know that its all nonsense, this
idea of his but he really thinks he is the king, and hes so old that
the shock of my disobeying him would be too much. onest, ed, dear, I
couldnt.

Gloom unutterable darkened ed radys always serious countenance. he
difficulties of the situation were beginning to come home to him.

Maybe if I went and saw him he suggested at last.

You could, said atie doubtfully.

ed tightened his belt with an air of determination, and bit resolutely
on the chewinggum which was his inseparable companion.

I will, he said.

Youll be nice to him, ed

e nodded. e was the man of action, not words.

It was perhaps ten minutes before he came out of the inner room in
which Mr ennett passed his days. When he did, there was no light of
ubilation on his face. is brow was darker than ever.

atie looked at him anxiously. e returned the look with a sombre shake
of the head.

othing doing, he said shortly. e paused. nless, he added, you
count it anything that hes made me an earl.

In the next two weeks several brains busied themselves with the
situation. Genevieve, reconciled to atie after a decent interval of
wounded dignity, said she supposed there was a way out, if one could
only think of it, but it certainly got past her. he only approach to a
plan of action was suggested by the brokennosed individual who had
been eds companion that day at alisades ark, a gentleman of some
eminence in the boxing world, who reoiced in the name of the ennessee
earCat.

What they ought to do, in the earCats opinion, was to get the old
man out into Washington uare one morning. e of ennessee would then
sasshay up in a flip manner and make a break. ed, waiting close by,
would resent his insolence. here would be words, followed by blows.

ee what I mean pursued the earCat. heres you and me mixing it.
Ill suare the cop on the beat to leave us be hes a friend of mine.
retty soon you land me one on the plexus, and I take th count. hen
theres you hauling me up by th collar to the old gentleman, and me
saying I uits and apologizing. ee what I mean

he whole, presumably, to conclude with warm expressions of gratitude
and esteem from Mr ennett, and an instant withdrawal of the veto.

ed himself approved of the scheme. e said it was a crackeraw, and
he wondered how one so notoriously ivoryskulled as the other could
have had such an idea. he earCat said modestly that he had em
sometimes. And it is probable that all would have been well, had it not
been necessary to tell the plan to atie, who was horrified at the very
idea, spoke warmly of the danger to her grandfathers nervous system,
and said she did not think the earCat could be a nice friend for ed.
And matters relapsed into their old state of hopelessness.

And then, one day, atie forced herself to tell ed that she thought it
would be better if they did not see each other for a time. he said
that these meetings were only a source of pain to both of them. It
would really be better if he did not come round forwell, uite some
time.

It had not been easy for her to say it. he decision was the outcome of
many wakeful nights. he had asked herself the uestion whether it was
fair for her to keep ed chained to her in this hopeless fashion, when,
left to himself and away from her, he might so easily find some other
girl to make him happy.

o ed went, reluctantly, and the little shop on ixth Avenue knew him
no more. And atie spent her time looking after old Mr ennett who had
completely forgotten the affair by now, and sometimes wondered why
atie was not so cheerful as she had been, andfor, though unselfish,
she was humanhating those unknown girls whom in her minds eye she
could see clustering round ed, smiling at him, making much of him, and
driving the bare recollection of her out of his mind.

he summer passed. uly came and went, making ew York an oven. August
followed, and one wondered why one had complained of ulys tepid
advances.

It was on the evening of eptember the eleventh that atie, having
closed the little shop, sat in the dusk on the steps, as many thousands
of her fellowtownsmen and townswomen were doing, turning her face to
the first breeze which ew York had known for two months. he hot spell
had broken abruptly that afternoon, and the city was drinking in the
coolness as a flower drinks water.

rom round the corner, where the yellow cross of the udson otel shone
down on Washington uare, came the shouts of children, and the
strains, mellowed by distance, of the indefatigable barrelorgan which
had played the same tunes in the same place since the spring.

atie closed her eyes, and listened. It was very peaceful this evening,
so peaceful that for an instant she forgot even to think of ed. And it
was ust during this instant that she heard his voice.

hat you, kid

e was standing before her, his hands in his pockets, one foot on the
pavement, the other in the road and if he was agitated, his voice did
not show it.

ed

hats me. Can I see the old man for a minute, atie

his time it did seem to her that she could detect a slight ring of
excitement.

Its no use, ed. onest.

o harm in going in and passing the time of day, is there Ive got
something I want to say to him.

What

ell you later, maybe. Is he in his room

e stepped past her, and went in. As he went, he caught her arm and
pressed it, but he did not stop. he saw him go into the inner room and
heard through the door as he closed it behind him, the murmur of
voices. And almost immediately, it seemed to her, her name was called.
It was her grandfathers voice which called, high and excited. he door
opened, and ed appeared.

Come here a minute, atie, will you he said. Youre wanted.

he old man was leaning forward in his chair. e was in a state of
extraordinary excitement. e uivered and umped. ed, standing by the
wall, looked as stolid as ever but his eyes glittered.

atie, cried the old man, this is a most remarkable piece of news.
his gentleman has ust been telling meextraordinary. e

e broke off, and looked at ed, as he had looked at atie when he had
tried to write the letter to the arliament of ngland.

eds eye, as it met aties, was almost defiant.

I want to marry you, he said.

Yes, yes, broke in Mr ennett, impatiently, but

And Im a king.

Yes, yes, thats it, thats it, atie. his gentleman is a king.

nce more eds eye met aties, and this time there was an imploring
look in it.

hats right, he said, slowly. Ive ust been telling your
grandfather Im the ing of Coney Island.

hats it. f Coney Island.

o theres no obection now to us getting married, kidYour oyal
ighness. Its a royal alliance, see

A royal alliance, echoed Mr ennett.

ut in the street, ed held aties hand, and grinned a little
sheepishly.

Youre mighty uiet, kid, he said. It looks as if it dont make much
of a hit with you, the notion of being married to me.

h, ed ut

e sueezed her hand.

I know what youre thinking. I guess it was raw work pulling a tale
like that on the old man. I hated to do it, but gee when a fellows up
against it like I was, hes apt to grab most any chance that comes
along. Why, say, kid, it kind of looked to me as if it was sort of
meant. Coming ust now, like it did, ust when it was wanted,
and ust when it didnt seem possible it could happen. Why, a week ago
I was nigh on two hundred votes behind illy urton. he IrishAmerican
put him up, and everybody thought hed be ing at the Mardi Gras. And
then suddenly they came pouring in for me, till at the finish I had
illy looking like a regular hasbeen.

Its funny the way the voting umps about every year in this Coney
election. It was ust rovidence, and it didnt seem right to let it go
by. o I went in to the old man, and told him. ay, I tell you I was
ust sweating when I got ready to hand it to him. It was an outside
chance hed remember all about what the Mardi Gras at Coney was, and
ust what being a king at it amounted to. hen I remembered you telling
me youd never been to Coney, so I figured your grandfather wouldnt be
what youd call well fixed in his information about it, so I took the
chance.

I tried him out first. I tried him with rooklyn. Why, say, from the
way he took it, hed either never heard of the place, or else hed
forgotten what it was. I guess he dont remember much, poor old fellow.
hen I mentioned Yonkers. e asked me what Yonkers were. hen I
reckoned it was safe to bring on Coney, and he fell for it right away.
I felt mean, but it had to be done.

e caught her up, and swung her into the air with a perfectly impassive
face. hen, having kissed her, he lowered her gently to the ground
again. he action seemed to have relieved his feelings, for when he
spoke again it was plain that his conscience no longer troubled him.

And say, he said, come to think of it, I dont see where theres so
much call for me to feel mean. Im not so far short of being a regular
king. Coneys ust as big as some of those kingdoms you read about on
the other side and, from what you see in the papers about the
goingson there, it looks to me that, having a whole week on the throne
like Im going to have, amounts to a pretty steady ob as kings go.




A GIIM


As I walked to Geisenheimers that night I was feeling blue and
restless, tired of ew York, tired of dancing, tired of everything.
roadway was full of people hurrying to the theatres. Cars rattled by.
All the electric lights in the world were blazing down on the Great
White Way. And it all seemed stale and dreary to me.

Geisenheimers was full as usual. All the tables were occupied, and
there were several couples already on the dancingfloor in the centre.
he band was playing Michigan

     I want to go back, I want to go back
     o the place where I was born.
     ar away from harm
     With a milkpail on my arm.

I suppose the fellow who wrote that would have called for the police if
anyone had ever really tried to get him on to a farm, but he has
certainly put something into the tune which makes you think he meant
what he said. Its a homesick tune, that.

I was ust looking round for an empty table, when a man umped up and
came towards me, registering oy as if I had been his longlost sister.

e was from the country. I could see that. It was written all over him,
from his face to his shoes.

e came up with his hand out, beaming.

Why, Miss oxborough

Why not I said.

ont you remember me

I didnt.

My name is erris.

Its a nice name, but it means nothing in my young life.

I was introduced to you last time I came here. We danced together.

his seemed to bear the stamp of truth. If he was introduced to me, he
probably danced with me. Its what Im at Geisenheimers for.

When was it

A year ago last April.

You cant beat these rural charmers. hey think ew York is folded up
and put away in camphor when they leave, and only taken out again when
they pay their next visit. he notion that anything could possibly have
happened since he was last in our midst to blur the memory of that
happy evening had not occurred to Mr erris. I suppose he was so
accustomed to dating things from when I was in ew York that he
thought everybody else must do the same.

Why, sure, I remember you, I said. Algernon Clarence, isnt it

ot Algernon Clarence. My names Charlie.

My mistake. And whats the great scheme, Mr erris o you want to
dance with me again

e did. o we started. Mine not to reason why, mine but to do and die,
as the poem says. If an elephant had come into Geisenheimers and asked
me to dance Id have had to do it. And Im not saying that Mr erris
wasnt the next thing to it. e was one of those earnest, persevering
dancersthe kind that have taken twelve correspondence lessons.

I guess I was about due that night to meet someone from the country.
here still come days in the spring when the country seems to get a
stranglehold on me and start in pulling. his particular day had been
one of them. I got up in the morning and looked out of the window, and
the breeze ust wrapped me round and began whispering about pigs and
chickens. And when I went out on ifth Avenue there seemed to be
flowers everywhere. I headed for the ark, and there was the grass all
green, and the trees coming out, and a sort of something in the
airwhy, say, if there hadnt have been a big policeman keeping an eye
on me, Id have flung myself down and bitten chunks out of the turf.

And as soon as I got to Geisenheimers they played that Michigan
thing.

Why, Charlie from ueedunks entrance couldnt have been better
worked up if hed been a star in a roadway show. he stage was ust
waiting for him.

ut somebodys always taking the oy out of life. I ought to have
remembered that the most metropolitan thing in the metropolis is a
rustic whos putting in a week there. We werent thinking on the same
plane, Charlie and me. he way I had been feeling all day, what I
wanted to talk about was last seasons crops. he subect he fancied
was this seasons chorusgirls. ur souls didnt touch by a mile and a
half.

his is the life he said.

heres always a point when that sort of man says that.

I suppose you come here uite a lot he said.

retty often.

I didnt tell him that I came there every night, and that I came
because I was paid for it. If youre a professional dancer at
Geisenheimers, you arent supposed to advertise the fact. he
management thinks that if you did it might send the public away
thinking too hard when they saw you win the Great Contest for the
overly ilver Cup which they offer later in the evening. ay, that
overly Cups a oke. I win it on Mondays, Wednesdays, and ridays,
and Mabel rancis wins it on uesdays, hursdays, and aturdays. Its
all perfectly fair and suare, of course. Its purely a matter of merit
who wins the overly Cup. Anybody could win it. nly somehow they
dont. And the coincidence of the fact that Mabel and I always do has
kind of got on the managements nerves, and they dont like us to tell
people were employed there. hey prefer us to blush unseen.

Its a great place, said Mr erris, and ew Yorks a great place.
Id like to live in ew York.

he loss is ours. Why dont you

ome city ut dads dead now, and Ive got the drugstore, you know.

e spoke as if I ought to remember reading about it in the papers.

And Im making good with it, whats more. Ive got push and ideas.
ay, I got married since I saw you last.

You did, did you I said. hen what are you doing, may I ask,
dancing on roadway like a gay bachelor I suppose you have left your
wife at icks Corners, singing Where is my wandering boy tonight

ot icks Corners. Ashley, Maine. hats where I live. My wife comes
from odney.... ardon me, Im afraid I stepped on your foot.

My fault, I said I lost step. Well, I wonder you arent ashamed
even to think of your wife, when youve left her all alone out there
while you come whooping it up in ew York. avent you got any
conscience

ut I havent left her. hes here.

In ew York

In this restaurant. hats her up there.

I looked up at the balcony. here was a face hanging over the red plush
rail. It looked to me as if it had some hidden sorrow. Id noticed it
before, when we were dancing around, and I had wondered what the
trouble was. ow I began to see.

Why arent you dancing with her and giving her a good time, then I
said.

h, shes having a good time.

he doesnt look it. he looks as if she would like to be down here,
treading the measure.

he doesnt dance much.

ont you have dances at Ashley

Its different at home. he dances well enough for Ashley, butwell,
this isnt Ashley.

I see. ut youre not like that

e gave a kind of smirk.

h, Ive been in ew York before.

I could have bitten him, the sawnoff little rube It made me mad. e
was ashamed to dance in public with his wifedidnt think her good
enough for him. o he had dumped her in a chair, given her a lemonade,
and told her to be good, and then gone off to have a good time. hey
could have had me arrested for what I was thinking ust then.

he band began to play something else.

his is the life said Mr erris. ets do it again.

et somebody else do it, I said. Im tired. Ill introduce you to
some friends of mine.

o I took him off, and whisked him on to some girls I knew at one of
the tables.

hake hands with my friend Mr erris, I said. e wants to show you
the latest steps. e does most of them on your feet.

I could have betted on Charlie, the ebonair ride of Ashley. Guess
what he said e said, his is the life

And I left him, and went up to the balcony.

he was leaning with her elbows on the red plush, looking down on the
dancingfloor. hey had ust started another tune, and hubby was moving
around with one of the girls Id introduced him to. he didnt have to
prove to me that she came from the country. I knew it. he was a little
bit of a thing, oldfashioned looking. he was dressed in grey, with
white muslin collar and cuffs, and her hair done simple. he had a
black hat.

I kind of hovered for awhile. It isnt the best thing I do, being shy
as a general thing Im more or less there with the nerve but somehow I
sort of hesitated to charge in.

hen I braced up, and made for the vacant chair.

Ill sit here, if you dont mind, I said.

he turned in a startled way. I could see she was wondering who I was,
and what right I had there, but wasnt certain whether it might not be
city etiuette for strangers to come and dump themselves down and start
chatting. Ive ust been dancing with your husband, I said, to ease
things along.

I saw you.

he fixed me with a pair of big brown eyes. I took one look at them,
and then I had to tell myself that it might be pleasant, and a relief
to my feelings, to take something solid and heavy and drop it over the
rail on to hubby, but the management wouldnt like it. hat was how I
felt about him ust then. he poor kid was doing everything with those
eyes except crying. he looked like a dog thats been kicked.

he looked away, and fiddled with the string of the electric light.
here was a hatpin lying on the table. he picked it up, and began to
dig at the red plush.

Ah, come on sis, I said tell me all about it.

I dont know what you mean.

You cant fool me. ell me your troubles.

I dont know you.

You dont have to know a person to tell her your troubles. I sometimes
tell mine to the cat that camps out on the wall opposite my room. What
did you want to leave the country for, with summer coming on

he didnt answer, but I could see it coming, so I sat still and
waited. And presently she seemed to make up her mind that, even if it
was no business of mine, it would be a relief to talk about it.

Were on our honeymoon. Charlie wanted to come to ew York. I didnt
want to, but he was set on it. es been here before.

o he told me.

es wild about ew York.

ut youre not.

I hate it.

Why

he dug away at the red plush with the hatpin, picking out little bits
and dropping them over the edge. I could see she was bracing herself to
put me wise to the whole trouble. heres a time comes when things
arent going right, and youve had all you can stand, when you have got
to tell somebody about it, no matter who it is.

I hate ew York, she said getting it out at last with a rush. Im
scared of it. Itit isnt fair Charlie bringing me here. I didnt want
to come. I knew what would happen. I felt it all along.

What do you think will happen, then

he must have picked away at least an inch of the red plush before she
answered. Its lucky immy, the balcony waiter, didnt see her it
would have broken his heart hes as proud of that red plush as if he
had paid for it himself.

When I first went to live at odney, she said, two years agowe
moved there from Illinoisthere was a man there named ysonack
yson. e lived all alone and didnt seem to want to know anyone. I
couldnt understand it till somebody told me all about him. I can
understand it now. ack yson married a odney girl, and they came to
ew York for their honeymoon, ust like us. And when they got there I
guess she got to comparing him with the fellows she saw, and comparing
the city with odney, and when she got home she ust couldnt settle
down.

Well

After they had been back in odney for a little while she ran away.
ack to the city, I guess.

I suppose he got a divorce

o, he didnt. e still thinks she may come back to him.

e still thinks she will come back I said. After she has been away
three years

Yes. e keeps her things ust the same as she left them when she went
away, everything ust the same.

ut isnt he angry with her for what she did If I was a man and a
girl treated me that way, Id be apt to murder her if she tried to show
up again.

e wouldnt. or would I, ifif anything like that happened to me
Id wait and wait, and go on hoping all the time. And Id go down to
the station to meet the train every afternoon, ust like ack yson.

omething splashed on the tablecloth. It made me ump.

or goodness sake, I said, whats your trouble race up. I know
its a sad story, but its not your funeral.

It is. It is. he same things going to happen to me.

ake a hold on yourself. ont cry like that.

I cant help it. h I knew it would happen. Its happening right now.
ooklook at him.

I glanced over the rail, and I saw what she meant. here was her
Charlie, dancing about all over the floor as if he had ust discovered
that he hadnt lived till then. I saw him say something to the girl he
was dancing with. I wasnt near enough to hear it, but I bet it was
his is the life If I had been his wife, in the same position as
this kid, I guess Id have felt as bad as she did, for if ever a man
exhibited all the symptoms of incurable ewyorkitis, it was this
Charlie erris.

Im not like these ew York girls, she choked. I cant be smart. I
dont want to be. I ust want to live at home and be happy. I knew it
would happen if we came to the city. e doesnt think me good enough
for him. e looks down on me.

ull yourself together.

And I do love him so

Goodness knows what I should have said if I could have thought of
anything to say. ut ust then the music stopped, and somebody on the
floor below began to speak.

adeez n gemmen, he said, there will now take place our great
umbah Contest. his genuine sporting contest

It was Izzy aermann making his nightly speech, introducing the
overly Cup and it meant that, for me, duty called. rom where I sat
I could see Izzy looking about the room, and I knew he was looking for
me. Its the managements nightmare that one of these evenings Mabel or
I wont show up, and somebody else will get away with the overly
Cup.

orry Ive got to go, I said. I have to be in this.

And then suddenly I had the great idea. It came to me like a flash, I
looked at her, crying there, and I looked over the rail at Charlie the
oy Wonder, and I knew that this was where I got a stranglehold on my
place in the all of ame, along with the great thinkers of the age.

Come on, I said. Come along. top crying and powder your nose and
get a move on. Youre going to dance this.

ut Charlie doesnt want to dance with me.

It may have escaped your notice, I said, but your Charlie is not the
only man in ew York, or even in this restaurant. Im going to dance
with Charlie myself, and Ill introduce you to someone who can go
through the movements. isten

he lady of each couplethis was Izzy, getting it off his
diaphragmwill receive a ticket containing a numbah. he dance will
then proceed, and the numbahs will be eliminated one by one, those
called out by the udge kindly returning to their seats as their
numbah is called. he numbah finally remaining is the winning
numbah. he contest is a genuine sporting contest, decided purely by
the skill of the holders of the various numbahs. Izzy stopped
blushing at the age of six. Will ladies now kindly step forward and
receive their numbahs. he winner, the holder of the numbah left on
the floor when the other numbahs have been eliminated I could see
Izzy getting more and more uneasy, wondering where on earth Id got
to, will receive this overly ilver Cup, presented by the
management. adies will now kindly step forward and receive their
numbahs.

I turned to Mrs Charlie. here, I said, dont you want to win a
overly ilver Cup

ut I couldnt.

You never know your luck.

ut it isnt luck. idnt you hear him say its a contest decided
purely by skill

Well, try your skill, then. I felt as if I could have shaken her.
or goodness sake, I said, show a little grit. Arent you going to
stir a finger to keep your Charlie uppose you win, think what it will
mean. e will look up to you for the rest of your life. When he starts
talking about ew York, all you will have to say is, ew York Ah,
yes, that was the town I won that overly ilver Cup in, was it not
and hell drop as if you had hit him behind the ear with a sandbag.
ull yourself together and try.

I saw those brown eyes of hers flash, and she said, Ill try.

Good for you, I said. ow you get those tears dried, and fix
yourself up, and Ill go down and get the tickets.

Izzy was mighty relieved when I bore down on him.

Gee he said, I thought you had run away, or was sick or something.
eres your ticket.

I want two, Izzy. nes for a friend of mine. And I say, Izzy, Id
take it as a personal favour if you would let her stop on the floor as
one of the last two couples. heres a reason. hes a kid from the
country, and she wants to make a hit.

ure, thatll be all right. ere are the tickets. Yours is thirtysix,
hers is ten. e lowered his voice. ont go mixing them.

I went back to the balcony. n the way I got hold of Charlie.

Were dancing this together, I said.

e grinned all across his face.

I found Mrs Charlie looking as if she had never shed a tear in her
life. he certainly had pluck, that kid.

Come on, I said. tick to your ticket like wax and watch your step.

I guess youve seen these sporting contests at Geisenheimers. r, if
you havent seen them at Geisenheimers, youve seen them somewhere
else. heyre all the same.

When we began, the floor was so crowded that there was hardly
elbowroom. ont tell me there arent any optimists nowadays. veryone
was looking as if they were wondering whether to have the overly Cup
in the sittingroom or the bedroom. You never saw such a hopeful gang
in your life.

resently Izzy gave tongue. he management expects him to be humorous
on these occasions, so he did his best.

umbahs, seven, eleven, and twentyone will kindly reoin their
sorrowing friends.

his gave us a little more elbowroom, and the band started again.

A few minutes later, Izzy once more umbahs thirteen, sixteen, and
seventeengoodbye.

ff we went again.

umbah twelve, we hate to part with you, butback to your table

A plump girl in a red hat, who had been dancing with a kind smile, as
if she were doing it to amuse the children, left the floor.

umbahs six, fifteen, and twenty, thumbs down

And pretty soon the only couples left were Charlie and me, Mrs Charlie
and the fellow Id introduced her to, and a baldheaded man and a girl
in a white hat. e was one of your stickatit performers. e had been
dancing all the evening. I had noticed him from the balcony. e looked
like a hardboiled egg from up there.

e was a trier all right, that fellow, and had things been otherwise,
so to speak, Id have been glad to see him win. ut it was not to be.
Ah, no

umbah nineteen, youre getting all flushed. ake a rest.

o there it was, a straight contest between me and Charlie and Mrs
Charlie and her man. very nerve in my system was tingling with
suspense and excitement, was it not It was not.

Charlie, as Ive already hinted, was not a dancer who took much of his
attention off his feet while in action. e was there to do his
durnedest, not to inspect obects of interest by the wayside. he
correspondence college hed attended doesnt guarantee to teach you to
do two things at once. It wont bind itself to teach you to look round
the room while youre dancing. o Charlie hadnt the least suspicion of
the state of the drama. e was breathing heavily down my neck in a
determined sort of way, with his eyes glued to the floor. All he knew
was that the competition had thinned out a bit, and the honour of
Ashley, Maine, was in his hands.

You know how the public begins to sit up and take notice when these
dancecontests have been narrowed down to two couples. here are
evenings when I uite forget myself, when Im one of the last two left
in, and get all excited. heres a sort of hum in the air, and, as you
go round the room, people at the tables start applauding. Why, if you
didnt know about the inner workings of the thing, youd be all of a
twitter.

It didnt take my practised ear long to discover that it wasnt me and
Charlie that the great public was cheering for. We would go round the
floor without getting a hand, and every time Mrs Charlie and her guy
got to a corner there was a noise like election night. he sure had
made a hit.

I took a look at her across the floor, and I didnt wonder. he was a
different kid from what shed been upstairs. I never saw anybody look
so happy and pleased with herself. er eyes were like lamps, and her
cheeks all pink, and she was going at it like a champion. I knew what
had made a hit with the people. It was the look of her. he made you
think of fresh milk and newlaid eggs and birds singing. o see her was
like getting away to the country in August. Its funny about people who
live in the city. hey chuck out their chests, and talk about little
old ew York being good enough for them, and theres a street in heaven
they call roadway, and all the rest of it but it seems to me that
what they really live for is that three weeks in the summer when they
get away into the country. I knew exactly why they were cheering so
hard for Mrs Charlie. he made them think of their holidays which were
coming along, when they would go and board at the farm and drink out of
the old oaken bucket, and call the cows by their first names.

Gee I felt ust like that myself. All day the country had been tugging
at me, and now it tugged worse than ever.

I could have smelled the newmown hay if it wasnt that when youre in
Geisenheimers you have to smell Geisenheimers, because it leaves no
chance for competition.

eep working, I said to Charlie. It looks to me as if we are going
back in the betting.

h, huh he says, too busy to blink.

o some of those fancy steps of yours. We need them in our business.

And the way that boy workedit was astonishing

ut of the corner of my eye I could see Izzy aermann, and he wasnt
looking happy. e was nerving himself for one of those uick referees
decisionsthe sort you make and then duck under the ropes, and run
five miles, to avoid the incensed populace. It was this kind of thing
happening every now and then that prevented his ob being perfect.
Mabel rancis told me that one night when Izzy declared her the winner
of the great sporting contest, it was such raw work that she thought
thered have been a riot. It looked pretty much as if he was afraid the
same thing was going to happen now. here wasnt a doubt which of us
two couples was the one that the customers wanted to see win that
overly ilver Cup. It was a walkover for Mrs Charlie, and Charlie
and I were simply among those present.

ut Izzy had his duty to do, and drew a salary for doing it, so he
moistened his lips, looked round to see that his strategic railways
werent blocked, swallowed twice, and said in a husky voice

umbah ten, please retiah

I stopped at once.

Come along, said I to Charlie. hats our exit cue.

And we walked off the floor amidst applause.

Well, says Charlie, taking out his handkerchief and attending to his
brow, which was like the village blacksmiths, we didnt do so bad,
did we We didnt do so bad, I guess We

And he looked up at the balcony, expecting to see the dear little wife,
draped over the rail, worshipping him when, ust as his eye is moving
up, it gets caught by the sight of her a whole heap lower down than he
had expectedon the floor, in fact.

he wasnt doing much in the worshipping line ust at that moment. he
was too busy.

It was a regular triumphal progress for the kid. he and her partner
were doing one or two rounds now for exhibition purposes, like the
winning couple always do at Geisenheimers, and the room was fairly
rising at them. Youd have thought from the way they were clapping that
they had been betting all their spare cash on her.

Charlie gets her well focused, then he lets his aw drop, till he
pretty near bumped it against the floor.

utbutbut he begins.

I know, I said. It begins to look as if she could dance well enough
for the city after all. It begins to look as if she had sort of put one
over on somebody, dont it It begins to look as if it were a pity you
didnt think of dancing with her yourself.

III

You come along and have a nice cold drink, I said, and youll soon
pick up.

e tottered after me to a table, looking as if he had been hit by a
streetcar. e had got his.

I was so busy looking after Charlie, flapping the towel and working on
him with the oxygen, that, if youll believe me, it wasnt for uite a
time that I thought of glancing around to see how the thing had struck
Izzy aermann.

If you can imagine a fond father whose only son has hit him with a
brick, umped on his stomach, and then gone off with all his money, you
have a pretty good notion of how poor old Izzy looked. e was staring
at me across the room, and talking to himself and erking his hands
about. Whether he thought he was talking to me, or whether he was
rehearsing the scene where he broke it to the boss that a mere stranger
had got away with his overly ilver Cup, I dont know. Whichever it
was, he was being mighty elouent.

I gave him a nod, as much as to say that it would all come right in the
future, and then I turned to Charlie again. e was beginning to pick
up.

he won the cup he said in a dazed voice, looking at me as if I
could do something about it.

You bet she did

utwell, what do you know about that

I saw that the moment had come to put it straight to him. Ill tell
you what I know about it, I said. If you take my advice, youll hustle
that kid straight back to Ashleyor wherever it is that you said you
poison the natives by making up the wrong prescriptionsbefore she
gets ew York into her system. When I was talking to her upstairs, she
was telling me about a fellow in her village who got it in the neck
ust the same as youre apt to do.

e started. he was telling you about ack yson

hat was his nameack yson. e lost his wife through letting her
have too much ew York. ont you think its funny she should have
mentioned him if she hadnt had some idea that she might act ust the
same as his wife did

e turned uite green.

You dont think she would do that

Well, if youd heard herhe couldnt talk of anything except this
yson, and what his wife did to him. he talked of it sort of sad, kind
of regretful, as if she was sorry, but felt that it had to be. I could
see she had been thinking about it a whole lot.

Charlie stiffened in his seat, and then began to melt with pure fright.
e took up his empty glass with a shaking hand and drank a long drink
out of it. It didnt take much observation to see that he had had the
olt he wanted, and was going to be a whole heap less aunty and
metropolitan from now on. In fact, the way he looked, I should say he
had finished with metropolitan auntiness for the rest of his life.

Ill take her home tomorrow, he said. utwill she come

hats up to you. If you can persuade herere she is now. I should
start at once.

Mrs Charlie, carrying the cup, came to the table. I was wondering what
would be the first thing she would say. If it had been Charlie, of
course hed have said, his is the life but I looked for something
snappier from her. If I had been in her place there were at least ten
things I could have thought of to say, each nastier than the other.

he sat down and put the cup on the table. hen she gave the cup a long
look. hen she drew a deep breath. hen she looked at Charlie.

h, Charlie, dear, she said, I do wish Id been dancing with you

Well, Im not sure that that wasnt ust as good as anything I would
have said. Charlie got right off the mark. After what I had told him,
he wasnt wasting any time.

arling, he said, humbly, youre a wonder What will they say about
this at home e did pause here for a moment, for it took nerve to say
it but then he went right on. Mary, how would it be if we went home
right awayfirst train tomorrow, and showed it to them

h, Charlie she said.

is face lit up as if somebody had pulled a switch.

You will You dont want to stop on You arent wild about ew York

If there was a train, she said, Id start tonight. ut I thought you
loved the city so, Charlie

e gave a kind of shiver. I never want to see it again in my life he
said.

Youll excuse me, I said, getting up, I think theres a friend of
mine wants to speak to me.

And I crossed over to where Izzy had been standing for the last five
minutes, making signals to me with his eyebrows.

You couldnt have called Izzy coherent at first. e certainly had
trouble with his vocal chords, poor fellow. here was one of those
African explorer men used to come to Geisenheimers a lot when he was
home from roaming the trackless desert, and he used to tell me about
tribes he had met who didnt use real words at all, but talked to one
another in clicks and gurgles. e imitated some of their chatter one
night to amuse me, and, believe me, Izzy aermann started talking the
same language now. nly he didnt do it to amuse me.

e was like one of those gramophone records when its getting into its
stride.

e calm, Isadore, I said. omething is troubling you. ell me all
about it.

e clicked some more, and then he got it out.

ay, are you crazy What did you do it for idnt I tell you as plain
as I could didnt I say it twenty times, when you came for the
tickets, that yours was thirtysix

idnt you say my friends was thirtysix

Are you deaf I said hers was ten.

hen, I said handsomely, say no more. he mistake was mine. It
begins to look as if I must have got them mixed.

e did a few wedish exercises.

ay no more hats good hats great Youve got nerve. Ill say
that.

It was a lucky mistake, Izzy. It saved your life. he people would
have lynched you if you had given me the cup. hey were solid for her.

Whats the boss going to say when I tell him

ever mind what the boss will say. avent you any romance in your
system, Izzy ook at those two sitting there with their heads
together. Isnt it worth a silver cup to have made them happy for life
hey are on their honeymoon, Isadore. ell the boss exactly how it
happened, and say that I thought it was up to Geisenheimers to give
them a weddingpresent.

e clicked for a spell.

Ah he said. Ah now youve done it ow youve given yourself away
You did it on purpose. You mixed those tickets on purpose. I thought as
much. ay, who do you think you are, doing this sort of thing ont
you know that professional dancers are three for ten cents I could go
out right now and whistle, and get a dozen girls for your ob. he
bossll sack you ust one minute after I tell him.

o, he wont, Izzy, because Im going to resign.

Youd better

hats what I think. Im sick of this place, Izzy. Im sick of
dancing. Im sick of ew York. Im sick of everything. Im going back
to the country. I thought I had got the pigs and chickens clear out of
my system, but I hadnt. Ive suspected it for a long, long time, and
tonight I know it. ell the boss, with my love, that Im sorry, but it
had to be done. And if he wants to talk back, he must do it by letter
Mrs ohn yson, odney, Maine, is the address.




 MAIG  MAC


Macs estaurantnobody calls it Macarlandsis a mystery. It is off
the beaten track. It is not smart. It does not advertise. It provides
nothing nearer to an orchestra than a solitary piano, yet, with all
these things against it, it is a success. In theatrical circles
especially it holds a position which might turn the white lights of
many a supperpalace green with envy.

his is mysterious. You do not expect oho to compete with and even
eclipse iccadilly in this way. And when oho does so compete, there is
generally romance of some kind somewhere in the background.

omebody happened to mention to me casually that enry, the old waiter,
had been at Macs since its foundation.

Me said enry, uestioned during a slack spell in the afternoon.
ather

hen can you tell me what it was that first gave the place the impetus
which started it on its upward course What causes should you say were
responsible for its phenomenal prosperity What

What gave it a legup Is that what youre trying to get at

xactly. What gave it a legup Can you tell me

Me said enry. ather

And he told me this chapter from the unwritten history of the ondon
whose day begins when atures finishes.

                                   

ld Mr Macarland said enry started the place fifteen years
ago. e was a widower with one son and what you might call half a
daughter. hats to say, he had adopted her. atie was her name, and
she was the child of a dead friend of his. he sons name was Andy. A
little freckled nipper he was when I first knew himone of those
silent kids that dont say much and have as much obstinacy in them as
if they were mules. Manys the time, in them days, Ive clumped him on
the head and told him to do something and he didnt run yelling to his
pa, same as most kids would have done, but ust said nothing and went
on not doing whatever it was I had told him to do. hat was the sort of
disposition Andy had, and it grew on him. Why, when he came back from
xford College the time the old man sent for himwhat Im going to
tell you about soonhe had a aw on him like the ram of a battleship.
atie was the kid for my money. I liked atie. We all liked atie.

ld Macarland started out with two big advantages. ne was ules, and
the other was me. ules came from aris, and he was the greatest cook
you ever seen. And mewell, I was ust come from ten years as waiter
at the Guelph, and I wont conceal it from you that I gave the place a
tone. I gave oho something to think about over its chop, believe me.
It was a comedown in the world for me, maybe, after the Guelph, but
what I said to myself was that, when you get a tip in oho, it may be
only tuppence, but you keep it whereas at the Guelph about ninetynine
hundredths of it goes to helping to maintain some blooming head waiter
in the style to which he has been accustomed. It was through my kind of
harping on that fact that me and the Guelph parted company. he head
waiter complained to the management the day I called him a fatheaded
vampire.

Well, what with me and what with ules, Macarlandsit wasnt Macs
in them daysbegan to get a move on. ld Macarland, who knew a good
man when he saw one and always treated me more like a brother than
anything else, used to say to me, enry, if this keeps up, Ill be
able to send the boy to xford College until one day he changed it
to, enry, Im going to send the boy to xford College and next
year, sure enough, off he went.

atie was sixteen then, and she had ust been given the cashier ob, as
a treat. he wanted to do something to help the old man, so he put her
on a high chair behind a wire cage with a hole in it, and she gave the
customers their change. And let me tell you, mister, that a man that
wasnt satisfied after hed had me serve him a dinner cooked by ules
and then had a chat with atie through the wire cage would have groused
at aradise. or she was pretty, was atie, and getting prettier every
day. I spoke to the boss about it. I said it was putting temptation in
the girls way to set her up there right in the public eye, as it were.
And he told me to hop it. o I hopped it.

atie was wild about dancing. obody knew it till later, but all this
while, it turned out, she was attending regular one of them schools.
hat was where she went to in the afternoons, when we all thought she
was visiting girl friends. It all come out after, but she fooled us
then. Girls are like monkeys when it comes to artfulness. he called me
ncle ill, because she said the name enry always reminded her of cold
mutton. If it had been young Andy that had said it Id have clumped him
one but he never said anything like that. Come to think of it, he
never said anything much at all. e ust thought a heap without opening
his face.

o young Andy went off to college, and I said to him, ow then, you
young devil, you be a credit to us, or Ill fetch you a clip when you
come home. And atie said, h, Andy, I shall miss you. And
Andy didnt say nothing to me, and he didnt say nothing to atie, but
he gave her a look, and later in the day I found her crying, and she
said shed got toothache, and I went round the corner to the chemists
and brought her something for it.

It was in the middle of Andys second year at college that the old man
had the stroke which put him out of business. e went down under it as
if hed been hit with an axe, and the doctor tells him hell never be
able to leave his bed again.

o they sent for Andy, and he uit his college, and come back to ondon
to look after the restaurant.

I was sorry for the kid. I told him so in a fatherly kind of way. And
he ust looked at me and says, hanks very much, enry.

What must be must be, I says. Maybe, its all for the best. Maybe
its better youre here than in among all those young devils in your
xford school what might be leading you astray.

If you would think less of me and more of your work, enry, he says,
perhaps that gentleman over there wouldnt have to shout sixteen times
for the waiter.

Which, on looking into it, I found to be the case, and he went away
without giving me no tip, which shows what you lose in a hard world by
being sympathetic.

Im bound to say that young Andy showed us all olly uick that he
hadnt come home ust to be an ornament about the place. here was
exactly one boss in the restaurant, and it was him. It come a little
hard at first to have to be respectful to a kid whose head you had
spent many a happy hour clumping for his own good in the past but he
pretty soon showed me I could do it if I tried, and I done it. As for
ules and the two young fellers that had been taken on to help me owing
to increase of business, they would ump through hoops and roll over if
he ust looked at them. e was a boy who liked his own way, was Andy,
and, believe me, at Macarlands estaurant he got it.

And then, when things had settled down into a steady og, atie took
the bit in her teeth.

he done it uite uiet and unexpected one afternoon when there was
only me and her and Andy in the place. And I dont think either of them
knew I was there, for I was taking an easy on a chair at the back,
reading an evening paper.

he said, kind of uiet, h, Andy.

Yes, darling, he said.

And that was the first I knew that there was anything between them.

Andy, Ive something to tell you.

What is it

he kind of hesitated.

Andy, dear, I shant be able to help any more in the restaurant.

e looked at her, sort of surprised.

What do you mean

ImIm going on the stage.

I put down my paper. What do you mean id I listen f course I
listened. What do you take me for

rom where I sat I could see young Andys face, and I didnt need any
more to tell me there was going to be trouble. hat aw of his was
right out. I forgot to tell you that the old man had died, poor old
feller, maybe six months before, so that now Andy was the real boss
instead of ust acting boss and whats more, in the nature of things,
he was, in a manner of speaking, aties guardian, with power to tell
her what she could do and what she couldnt. And I felt that atie
wasnt going to have any smooth passage with this stage business which
she was giving him. Andy didnt hold with the stagenot with any girl
he was fond of being on it anyway. And when Andy didnt like a thing he
said so.

e said so now.

You arent going to do anything of the sort.

ont be horrid about it, Andy dear. Ive got a big chance. Why should
you be horrid about it

Im not going to argue about it. You dont go.

ut its such a big chance. And Ive been working for it for years.

ow do you mean working for it

And then it came out about this dancingschool shed been attending
regular.

When shed finished telling him about it, he ust shoved out his aw
another inch.

You arent going on the stage.

ut its such a chance. I saw Mr Mandelbaum yesterday, and he saw me
dance, and he was very pleased, and said he would give me a solo dance
to do in this new piece hes putting on.

You arent going on the stage.

What I always say is, you cant beat tact. If youre smooth and tactful
you can get folks to do anything you want but if you ust shove your
aw out at them, and order them about, why, then they get their backs
up and sauce you. I knew atie well enough to know that she would do
anything for Andy, if he asked her properly but she wasnt going to
stand this sort of thing. ut you couldnt drive that into the head of
a feller like young Andy with a steamhammer.

he flared up, uick, as if she couldnt hold herself in no longer.

I certainly am, she said.

You know what it means

What does it mean

he end ofeverything.

he kind of blinked as if hed hit her, then she chucks her chin up.

ery well, she says. Goodbye.

Goodbye, says Andy, the pigheaded young mule and she walks out one
way and he walks out another.

                                   

I dont follow the drama much as a general rule, but seeing that it was
now, so to speak, in the family, I did keep an eye open for the
newspaper notices of he ose Girl, which was the name of the piece
which Mr Mandelbaum was letting atie do a solo dance in and while
some of them cussed the play considerable, they all gave atie a nice
word. ne feller said that she was like cold water on the morning
after, which is high praise coming from a newspaper man.

here wasnt a doubt about it. he was a success. You see, she was
something new, and ondon always sits up and takes notice when you give
it that.

here were pictures of her in the papers, and one evening paper had a
piece about ow I reserve My Youth signed by her. I cut it out and
showed it to Andy.

e gave it a look. hen he gave me a look, and I didnt like his eye.

Well he says.

ardon, I says.

What about it he says.

I dont know, I says.

Get back to your work, he says.

o I got back.

It was that same night that the ueer thing happened.

We didnt do much in the supper line at Macarlands as a rule in them
days, but we kept open, of course, in case oho should take it into its
head to treat itself to a welsh rabbit before going to bed so all
hands was on deck, ready for the call if it should come, at half past
eleven that night but we werent what you might term sanguine.

Well, ust on the halfhour, up drives a taxicab, and in comes a party
of four. here was a nut, another nut, a girl, and another girl. And
the second girl was atie.

allo, ncle ill she says.

Good evening, madam, I says dignified, being on duty.

h, stop it, ncle ill, she says. ay allo to a pal, and smile
prettily, or Ill tell them about the time you went to the White City.

Well, theres some bygones that are best left bygones, and the night at
the White City what she was alluding to was one of them. I still
maintain, as I always shall maintain, that the constable had no right
tobut, there, its a story that wouldnt interest you. And, anyway,
I was glad to see atie again, so I give her a smile.

ot so much of it, I says. ot so much of it. Im glad to see you,
atie.

hree cheers immy, I want to introduce you to my friend, ncle ill.
ed, this is ncle ill. iolet, this is ncle ill.

It wasnt my place to fetch her one on the side of the head, but Id of
liked to have for she was acting like shed never used to act when I
knew herall tough and bold. hen it come to me that she was nervous.
And natural, too, seeing young Andy might pop out any moment.

And sure enough out he popped from the back room at that very instant.
atie looked at him, and he looked at atie, and I seen his face get
kind of hard but he didnt say a word. And presently he went out
again.

I heard atie breathe sort of deep.

es looking well, ncle ill, aint he she says to me, very soft.

retty fair, I says. Well, kid, I been reading the pieces in the
papers. Youve knocked em.

Ah, dont ill, she says, as if Id hurt her. And me meaning only to
say the civil thing. Girls are rum.

When the party had paid their bill and give me a tip which made me
think I was back at the Guelph againonly there werent any ick
urpin of a head waiter standing by for his sharethey hopped it. ut
atie hung back and had a word with me.

e was looking well, wasnt he, ncle ill

ather

oesdoes he ever speak of me

I aint heard him.

I suppose hes still pretty angry with me, isnt he, ncle ill
Youre sure youve never heard him speak of me

o, to cheer her up, I tells her about the piece in the paper I showed
him but it didnt seem to cheer her up any. And she goes out.

he very next night in she come again for supper, but with different
nuts and different girls. here was six of them this time, counting
her. And theyd hardly sat down at their table, when in come the
fellers she had called immy and ed with two girls. And they sat
eating of their suppers and chaffing one another across the floor, all
as pleasant and sociable as you please.

I say, atie, I heard one of the nuts say, you were right. es
worth the price of admission.

I dont know who they meant, but they all laughed. And every now and
again Id hear them praising the food, which I dont wonder at, for
ules had certainly done himself proud. All artistic temperament, these
renchmen are. he moment I told him we had company, so to speak, he
blossomed like a flower does when you put it in water.

Ah, see, at last he says, trying to grab me and kiss me. ur fame
has gone abroad in the world which amuses himself, aint it or a good
supper connexion I have always prayed, and he has arrived.

Well, it did begin to look as if he was right. en highclass
supperfolk in an evening was pretty hot stuff for Macarlands. Im
bound to say I got excited myself. I cant deny that I missed the
Guelph at times.

n the fifth night, when the place was fairly packed and looked for all
the world like ddys or omanos, and me and the two young fellers
helping me was working double tides, I suddenly understood, and I went
up to atie and, bending over her very respectful with a bottle, I
whispers, ot stuff, kid. his is a olly fine boom youre working for
the old place. And by the way she smiled back at me, I seen I had
guessed right.

Andy was hanging round, keeping an eye on things, as he always done,
and I says to him, when I was passing, hes doing us proud, bucking
up the old place, aint she And he says, Get on with your work. And
I got on.

atie hung back at the door, when she was on her way out, and had a
word with me.

as he said anything about me, ncle ill

ot a word, I says.

And she goes out.

Youve probably noticed about ondon, mister, that a flock of sheep
isnt in it with the nuts, the way they all troop on each others heels
to supperplaces. ne month theyre all going to one place, next month
to another. omeone in the push starts the cry that hes found a new
place, and off they all go to try it. he trouble with most of the
places is that once theyve got the custom they think its going to
keep on coming and all theyve got to do is to lean back and watch it
come. opularity comes in at the door, and good food and good service
flies out at the window. We wasnt going to have any of that at
Macarlands. ven if it hadnt been that Andy would have come down
like half a ton of bricks on the first sign of slackness, ules and me
both of us had our professional reputations to keep up. I didnt give
myself no airs when I seen things coming our way. I worked all the
harder, and I seen to it that the four young fellers under methere
was four nowdidnt lose no time fetching of the orders.

he conseuence was that the difference between us and most popular
restaurants was that we kept our popularity. We fed them well, and we
served them well and once the thing had started rolling it didnt
stop. oho isnt so very far away from the centre of things, when you
come to look at it, and they didnt mind the extra step, seeing that
there was something good at the end of it. o we got our popularity,
and we kept our popularity and weve got it to this day. hats how
Macarlands came to be what it is, mister.

                                   

With the air of one who has told a wellrounded tale, enry ceased, and
observed that it was wonderful the way Mr Woodward, of Chelsea,
preserved his skill in spite of his advanced years.

I stared at him.

ut, heavens, man I cried, you surely dont think youve finished
What about atie and Andy What happened to them id they ever come
together again

h, ah, said enry, I was forgetting

And he resumed.

                                   

As time went on, I begin to get pretty fed up with young Andy. e was
making a fortune as fast as any feller could out of the sudden boom in
the suppercustom, and he knowing perfectly well that if it hadnt of
been for atie there wouldnt of been any suppercustom at all and
youd of thought that anyone claiming to be a human being would have
had the gratitood to forgive and forget and go over and say a civil
word to atie when she come in. ut no, he ust hung round looking
black at all of them and one night he goes and fairly does it.

he place was full that night, and atie was there, and the piano
going, and everybody enoying themselves, when the young feller at the
piano struck up the tune what atie danced to in the show. Catchy tune
it was. umtumtum, tiddleiddleum. omething like that it went.
Well, the young feller struck up with it, and everybody begin clapping
and hammering on the tables and hollering to atie to get up and dance
which she done, in an open space in the middle, and she hadnt hardly
started when along come young Andy.

e goes up to her, all aw, and I seen something that wanted dusting on
the table next to em, so I went up and began dusting it, so by good
luck I happened to hear the whole thing.

e says to her, very uiet, You cant do that here. What do you think
this place is

And she says to him, h, Andy

Im very much obliged to you, he says, for all the trouble you
seem to be taking, but it isnt necessary. Macarlands got on very
well before your wellmeant efforts to turn it into a beargarden.

And him coining the money from the suppercustom ometimes I
think gratitoods a thing of the past and this world not fit for
a selfrespecting rattlesnake to live in.

Andy she says.

hats all. We neednt argue about it. If you want to come here and
have supper, I cant stop you. ut Im not going to have the place
turned into a nightclub.

I dont know when Ive heard anything like it. If it hadnt of been
that I hadnt of got the nerve, Id have give him a look.

atie didnt say another word, but ust went back to her table.

ut the episode, as they say, wasnt conclooded. As soon as the party
she was with seen that she was through dancing, they begin to kick up a
row and one young nut with about an inch and a uarter of forehead and
the same amount of chin kicked it up especial.

o, I say I say, you know he hollered. hats too bad, you know.
ncore ont stop. ncore

Andy goes up to him.

I must ask you, please, not to make so much noise, he says, uite
respectful. You are disturbing people.

isturbing be damned Why shouldnt she

ne moment. You can make all the noise you please out in the street,
but as long as you stay in here youll be uiet. o you understand

p umps the nut. ed had uite enough to drink. I know, because Id
been serving him.

Who the devil are you he says.

it down, says Andy.

And the young feller took a smack at him. And the next moment Andy had
him by the collar and was chucking him out in a way that would have
done credit to a real professional down Whitechapel way. e dumped him
on the pavement as neat as you please.

hat broke up the party.

You can never tell with restaurants. What kills one makes another. Ive
no doubt that if we had chucked out a good customer from the Guelph
that would have been the end of the place. ut it only seemed to do
Macarlands good. I guess it gave ust that touch to the place which
made the nuts think that this was real ohemia. Come to think of it, it
does give a kind of charm to a place, if you feel that at any moment
the feller at the next table to you may be gathered up by the slack of
his trousers and slung into the street.

Anyhow, thats the way our suppercustom seemed to look at it and
after that you had to book a table in advance if you wanted to eat with
us. hey fairly flocked to the place.

ut atie didnt. he didnt flock. he stayed away. And no wonder,
after Andy behaving so bad. Id of spoke to him about it, only he
wasnt the kind of feller you do speak to about things.

ne day I says to him to cheer him up, What price this restaurant now,
Mr Andy

Curse the restaurant, he says.

And him with all that suppercustom Its a rum world

Mister, have you ever had a real shocksomething that came out of
nowhere and ust knocked you flat I have, and Im going to tell you
about it.

When a man gets to be my age, and has a ob of work which keeps him
busy till its time for him to go to bed, he gets into the habit of not
doing much worrying about anything that aint shoved right under his
nose. hats why, about now, atie had kind of slipped my mind. It
wasnt that I wasnt fond of the kid, but Id got so much to think
about, what with having four young fellers under me and things being in
such a rush at the restaurant that, if I thought of her at all, I ust
took it for granted that she was getting along all right, and didnt
bother. o be sure we hadnt seen nothing of her at Macarlands since
the night when Andy bounced her pal with the small size in foreheads,
but that didnt worry me. If Id been her, Id have stopped away the
same as she done, seeing that young Andy still had his hump. I took it
for granted, as Im telling you, that she was all right, and that the
reason we didnt see nothing of her was that she was taking her
patronage elsewhere.

And then, one evening, which happened to be my evening off, I got a
letter, and for ten minutes after I read it I was knocked flat.

You get to believe in fate when you get to be my age, and fate certainly
had taken a hand in this game. If it hadnt of been my evening off,
dont you see, I wouldnt have got home till one oclock or past that
in the morning, being on duty. Whereas, seeing it was my evening off,
I was back at half past eight.

I was living at the same boardinghouse in loomsbury what Id lived at
for the past ten years, and when I got there I find her letter shoved
half under my door.

I can tell you every word of it. his is how it went

  arling ncle ill,

  ont be too sorry when you read this. It is nobodys fault,
  but I am ust tired of everything, and I want to end it all. You
  have been such a dear to me always that I want you to be good to
  me now. I should not like Andy to know the truth, so I want you
  to make it seem as if it had happened naturally. You will do this
  for me, wont you It will be uite easy. y the time you get this,
  it will be one, and it will all be over, and you can ust come up
  and open the window and let the gas out and then everyone will
  think I ust died naturally. It will be uite easy. I am leaving
  the door unlocked so that you can get in. I am in the room ust
  above yours. I took it yesterday, so as to be near you. Goodbye,
  ncle ill. You will do it for me, wont you I dont want Andy to
  know what it really was.

                                           AI

hat was it, mister, and I tell you it floored me. And then it come to
me, kind of as a new idea, that Id best do something pretty soon, and
up the stairs I went uick.

here she was, on the bed, with her eyes closed, and the gas ust
beginning to get bad.

As I come in, she umped up, and stood staring at me. I went to the
tap, and turned the flow off, and then I gives her a look.

ow then, I says.

ow did you get here

ever mind how I got here. What have you got to say for yourself

he ust began to cry, same as she used to when she was a kid and
someone had hurt her.

ere, I says, lets get along out of here, and go where theres some
air to breathe. ont you take on so. You come along out and tell me
all about it.

he started to walk to where I was, and suddenly I seen she was
limping. o I gave her a hand down to my room, and set her on a chair.

ow then, I says again.

ont be angry with me, ncle ill, she says.

And she looks at me so pitiful that I goes up to her and puts my arm
round her and pats her on the back.

ont you worry, dearie, I says, nobody aint going to be angry with
you. ut, for goodness sake, I says, tell a man why in the name of
goodness you ever took and acted so foolish.

I wanted to end it all.

ut why

he burst out acrying again, like a kid.

idnt you read about it in the paper, ncle ill

ead about what in the paper

My accident. I broke my ankle at rehearsal ever so long ago, practising
my new dance. he doctors say it will never be right again. I shall
never be able to dance any more. I shall always limp. I shant even be
able to walk properly. And when I thought of that ... and Andy ... and
everything ... I....

I got on to my feet.

Well, well, well, I says. Well, well, well I dont know as I blame
you. ut dont you do it. Its a mugs game. ook here, if I leave you
alone for half an hour, you wont go trying it on again romise.

ery well, ncle ill. Where are you going

h, ust out. Ill be back soon. You sit there and rest yourself.

It didnt take me ten minutes to get to the restaurant in a cab. I
found Andy in the back room.

Whats the matter, enry he says.

ake a look at this, I says.

heres always this risk, mister, in being the Andy type of feller what
must have his own way and goes straight ahead and has it and that is
that when trouble does come to him, it comes with a rush. It sometimes
seems to me that in this life weve all got to have trouble sooner or
later, and some of us gets it bit by bit, spread out thin, so to speak,
and a few of us gets it in a lumpbiff And that was what
happened to Andy, and what I knew was going to happen when I showed him
that letter. I nearly says to him, race up, young feller, because
this is where you get it.

I dont often go to the theatre, but when I do I like one of those
plays with some ginger in them which the papers generally cuss. he
papers say that real human beings dont carry on in that way. ake it
from me, mister, they do. I seen a feller on the stage read a letter
once which didnt ust suit him and he gasped and rolled his eyes and
tried to say something and couldnt, and had to get a hold on a chair
to keep him from falling. here was a piece in the paper saying that
this was all wrong, and that he wouldnt of done them things in real
life. elieve me, the paper was wrong. here wasnt a thing that feller
did that Andy didnt do when he read that letter.

God he says. Is she ... he isnt.... Were you in time he says.

And he looks at me, and I seen that he had got it in the neck, right
enough.

If you mean is she dead, I says, no, she aint dead.

hank God

ot yet, I says.

And the next moment we was out of that room and in the cab and moving
uick.

e was never much of a talker, wasnt Andy, and he didnt chat in that
cab. e didnt say a word till we was going up the stairs.

Where he says.

ere, I says.

And I opens the door.

atie was standing looking out of the window. he turned as the door
opened, and then she saw Andy. er lips parted, as if she was going to
say something, but she didnt say nothing. And Andy, he didnt say
nothing, neither. e ust looked, and she ust looked.

And then he sort of stumbles across the room, and goes down on his
knees, and gets his arms around her.

h, my kid he says.

                                   

And I seen I wasnt wanted, so I shut the door, and I hopped it. I went
and saw the last half of a musichall. ut, I dont know, it didnt
kind of have no fascination for me. Youve got to give your mind to it
to appreciate good musichall turns.




 C  A


he feelings of Mr . Wilmot irdsey, as he stood wedged in the crowd
that moved inch by inch towards the gates of the Chelsea ootball
Ground, rather resembled those of a starving man who has ust been
given a meal but realizes that he is not likely to get another for many
days. e was full and happy. e bubbled over with the oy of living and
a warm affection for his fellowman. At the back of his mind there
lurked the black shadow of future privations, but for the moment he did
not allow it to disturb him. n this maddest, merriest day of all the
glad ew Year he was content to revel in the present and allow the
future to take care of itself.

Mr irdsey had been doing something which he had not done since he left
ew York five years ago. e had been watching a game of baseball.

ew York lost a great baseball fan when ugo ercy de Wynter
ramlinghame, sixth arl of Carricksteed, married Mae linor, only
daughter of Mr and Mrs . Wilmot irdsey of ast eventyhird treet
for scarcely had that internationally important event taken place when
Mrs irdsey, announcing that for the future the home would be in
ngland as near as possible to dear Mae and dear ugo, scooped .
Wilmot out of his comfortable morris chair as if he had been a clam,
corked him up in a swift taxicab, and decanted him into a eck 
stateroom on the lympic. And there he was, an exile.

Mr irdsey submitted to the worst bit of kidnapping since the days of
the old press gang with that delightful amiability which made him so
popular among his fellows and such a cypher in his home. At an early
date in his married life his position had been clearly defined beyond
possibility of mistake. It was his business to make money, and, when
called upon, to ump through hoops and sham dead at the bidding of his
wife and daughter Mae. hese duties he had been performing
conscientiously for a matter of twenty years.

It was only occasionally that his humble role arred upon him, for he
loved his wife and idolized his daughter. he international alliance
had been one of these occasions. e had no obection to ugo ercy,
sixth arl of Carricksteed. he crushing blow had been the sentence of
exile. e loved baseball with a love passing the love of women, and the
prospect of never seeing a game again in his life appalled him.

And then, one morning, like a voice from another world, had come the
news that the White ox and the Giants were to give an exhibition in
ondon at the Chelsea ootball Ground. e had counted the days like a
child before Christmas.

here had been obstacles to overcome before he could attend the game,
but he had overcome them, and had been seated in the front row when the
two teams lined up before ing George.

And now he was moving slowly from the ground with the rest of the
spectators. ate had been very good to him. It had given him a great
game, even unto two homeruns. ut its crowning benevolence had been to
allot the seats on either side of him to two men of his own mettle, two
godlike beings who knew every move on the board, and howled like
wolves when they did not see eye to eye with the umpire. ong before
the ninth innings he was feeling towards them the affection of a
shipwrecked mariner who meets a couple of boyhoods chums on a desert
island.

As he shouldered his way towards the gate he was aware of these two
men, one on either side of him. e looked at them fondly, trying to
make up his mind which of them he liked best. It was sad to think that
they must soon go out of his life again for ever.

e came to a sudden resolution. e would postpone the parting. e would
ask them to dinner. ver the best that the avoy otel could provide
they would fight the afternoons battle over again. e did not know who
they were or anything about them, but what did that matter hey were
brotherfans. hat was enough for him.

he man on his right was young, cleanshaven, and of a somewhat
vulturine cast of countenance. is face was cold and impassive now,
almost forbiddingly so but only half an hour before it had been a
battlefield of conflicting emotions, and his hat still showed the dent
where he had banged it against the edge of his seat on the occasion of
Mr alys homerun. A worthy guest

he man on Mr irdseys left belonged to another species of fan. hough
there had been times during the game when he had howled, for the most
part he had watched in silence so hungrily tense that a less
experienced observer than Mr irdsey might have attributed his
immobility to boredom. ut one glance at his set aw and gleaming eyes
told him that here also was a man and a brother.

his mans eyes were still gleaming, and under their curiously deep tan
his bearded cheeks were pale. e was staring straight in front of him
with an unseeing gaze.

Mr irdsey tapped the young man on the shoulder.

ome game he said.

he young man looked at him and smiled.

You bet, he said.

I havent seen a ballgame in five years.

he last one I saw was two years ago next une.

Come and have some dinner at my hotel and talk it over, said Mr
irdsey impulsively.

ure said the young man.

Mr irdsey turned and tapped the shoulder of the man on his left.

he result was a little unexpected. he man gave a start that was
almost a leap, and the pallor of his face became a sickly white. is
eyes, as he swung round, met Mr irdseys for an instant before they
dropped, and there was panic fear in them. is breath whistled softly
through clenched teeth.

Mr irdsey was taken aback. he cordiality of the cleanshaven young
man had not prepared him for the possibility of such a reception. e
felt chilled. e was on the point of apologizing with some murmur about
a mistake, when the man reassured him by smiling. It was rather a
painful smile, but it was enough for Mr irdsey. his man might be of a
nervous temperament, but his heart was in the right place.

e, too, smiled. e was a small, stout, redfaced little man, and he
possessed a smile that rarely failed to set strangers at their ease.
Many strenuous years on the ew York tock xchange had not destroyed a
certain childlike amiability in Mr irdsey, and it shone out when he
smiled at you.

Im afraid I startled you, he said soothingly. I wanted to ask you
if you would let a perfect stranger, who also happens to be an exile,
offer you dinner tonight.

he man winced. xile

An exiled fan. ont you feel that the olo Grounds are a good long
way away his gentleman is oining me. I have a suite at the avoy
otel, and I thought we might all have a uiet little dinner there and
talk about the game. I havent seen a ballgame in five years.

or have I.

hen you must come. You really must. We fans ought to stick to one
another in a strange land. o come.

hank you, said the bearded man I will.

When three men, all strangers, sit down to dinner together,
conversation, even if they happen to have a mutual passion for
baseball, is apt to be for a while a little difficult. he first fine
frenzy in which Mr irdsey had issued his invitations had begun to ebb
by the time the soup was served, and he was conscious of a feeling of
embarrassment.

here was some subtle hitch in the orderly progress of affairs. e
sensed it in the air. oth of his guests were disposed to silence, and
the cleanshaven young man had developed a trick of staring at the man
with the beard, which was obviously distressing that sensitive person.

Wine, murmured Mr irdsey to the waiter. Wine, wine

e spoke with the earnestness of a general calling up his reserves for
the grand attack. he success of this little dinner mattered enormously
to him. here were circumstances which were going to make it an oasis
in his life. e wanted it to be an occasion to which, in grey days to
come, he could look back and be consoled. e could not let it be a
failure.

e was about to speak when the young man anticipated him. eaning
forward, he addressed the bearded man, who was crumbling bread with an
absent look in his eyes.

urely we have met before he said. Im sure I remember your face.

he effect of these words on the other was as curious as the effect of
Mr irdseys tap on the shoulder had been. e looked up like a hunted
animal.

e shook his head without speaking.

Curious, said the young man. I could have sworn to it, and I am
positive that it was somewhere in ew York. o you come from ew York

Yes.

It seems to me, said Mr irdsey, that we ought to introduce
ourselves. unny it didnt strike any of us before. My name is irdsey,
. Wilmot irdsey. I come from ew York.

My name is Waterall, said the young man. I come from ew York.

he bearded man hesitated.

My name is ohnson. Iused to live in ew York.

Where do you live now, Mr ohnson asked Waterall.

he bearded man hesitated again. Algiers, he said.

Mr irdsey was inspired to help matters along with smalltalk.

Algiers, he said. I have never been there, but I understand that it
is uite a place. Are you in business there, Mr ohnson

I live there for my health.

ave you been there some time inuired Waterall.

ive years.

hen it must have been in ew York that I saw you, for I have never
been to Algiers, and Im certain I have seen you somewhere. Im afraid
you will think me a bore for sticking to the point like this, but the
fact is, the one thing I pride myself on is my memory for faces. Its a
hobby of mine. If I think I remember a face, and cant place it, I
worry myself into insomnia. Its partly sheer vanity, and partly
because in my ob a good memory for faces is a mighty fine asset. It
has helped me a hundred times.

Mr irdsey was an intelligent man, and he could see that Wateralls
tabletalk was for some reason getting upon ohnsons nerves. ike a
good host, he endeavoured to cut in and make things smooth.

Ive heard great accounts of Algiers, he said helpfully. A friend of
mine was there in his yacht last year. It must be a delightful spot.

Its a hell on earth, snapped ohnson, and slew the conversation on
the spot.

hrough a grim silence an angel in human form fluttered ina waiter
bearing a bottle. he pop of the cork was more than music to Mr
irdseys ears. It was the booming of the guns of the relieving army.

he first glass, as first glasses will, thawed the bearded man, to the
extent of inducing him to try and pick up the fragments of the
conversation which he had shattered.

I am afraid you will have thought me abrupt, Mr irdsey, he said
awkwardly but then you havent lived in Algiers for five years, and I
have.

Mr irdsey chirruped sympathetically.

I liked it at first. It looked mighty good to me. ut five years of it,
and nothing else to look forward to till you die....

e stopped, and emptied his glass. Mr irdsey was still perturbed.
rue, conversation was proceeding in a sort of way, but it had taken a
distinctly gloomy turn. lightly flushed with the excellent champagne
which he had selected for this important dinner, he endeavoured to
lighten it.

I wonder, he said, which of us three fans had the greatest
difficulty in getting to the bleachers today. I guess none of us found
it too easy.

he young man shook his head.

ont count on me to contribute a romantic story to this Arabian
ights ntertainment. My difficulty would have been to stop away. My
names Waterall, and Im the ondon correspondent of the ew York
Chronicle. I had to be there this afternoon in the way of
business.

Mr irdsey giggled selfconsciously, but not without a certain impish
pride.

he laugh will be on me when you hear my confession. My daughter
married an nglish earl, and my wife brought me over here to mix with
his crowd. here was a big dinnerparty tonight, at which the whole
gang were to be present, and it was as much as my life was worth to
sidestep it. ut when you get the Giants and the White ox playing
ball within fifty miles of youWell, I packed a grip and sneaked out
the back way, and got to the station and caught the fast train to
ondon. And what is going on back there at this moment I dont like to
think. About now, said Mr irdsey, looking at his watch, I guess
theyll be pronging the hors doeuvres and gazing at the empty
chair. It was a shame to do it, but, for the love of Mike, what else
could I have done

e looked at the bearded man.

id you have any adventures, Mr ohnson

o. II ust came.

he young man Waterall leaned forward. is manner was uiet, but his
eyes were glittering.

Wasnt that enough of an adventure for you he said.

heir eyes met across the table. eated between them, Mr irdsey looked
from one to the other, vaguely disturbed. omething was happening, a
drama was going on, and he had not the key to it.

ohnsons face was pale, and the tablecloth crumpled into a crooked
ridge under his fingers, but his voice was steady as he replied

I dont understand.

Will you understand if I give you your right name, Mr enyon

Whats all this said Mr irdsey feebly.

Waterall turned to him, the vulturine cast of his face more noticeable
than ever. Mr irdsey was conscious of a sudden distaste for this young
man.

Its uite simple, Mr irdsey. If you have not been entertaining
angels unawares, you have at least been giving a dinner to a celebrity.
I told you I was sure I had seen this gentleman before. I have ust
remembered where, and when. his is Mr ohn enyon, and I last saw him
five years ago when I was a reporter in ew York, and covered his
trial.

is trial

e robbed the ew Asiatic ank of a hundred thousand dollars, umped
his bail, and was never heard of again.

or the love of Mike

Mr irdsey stared at his guest with eyes that grew momently wider. e
was amazed to find that deep down in him there was an unmistakable
feeling of elation. e had made up his mind, when he left home that
morning, that this was to be a day of days. Well, nobody could call
this an anticlimax.

o thats why you have been living in Algiers

enyon did not reply. utside, the trand traffic sent a faint murmur
into the warm, comfortable room.

Waterall spoke. What on earth induced you, enyon, to run the risk of
coming to ondon, where every second man you meet is a ew Yorker, I
cant understand. he chances were two to one that you would be
recognized. You made a pretty big splash with that little affair of
yours five years ago.

enyon raised his head. is hands were trembling.

Ill tell you, he said with a kind of savage force, which hurt kindly
little Mr irdsey like a blow. It was because I was a dead man, and
saw a chance of coming to life for a day because I was sick of the
damned tomb Ive been living in for five centuries because Ive been
aching for ew York ever since Ive left itand here was a chance of
being back there for a few hours. I knew there was a risk. I took a
chance on it. Well

Mr irdseys heart was almost too full for words. e had found him at
last, the uperan, the man who would go through fire and water for a
sight of a game of baseball. ill that moment he had been regarding
himself as the nearest approach to that dizzy eminence. e had braved
great perils to see this game. ven in this moment his mind would not
wholly detach itself from speculation as to what his wife would say to
him when he slunk back into the fold. ut what had he risked compared
with this man enyon Mr irdsey glowed. e could not restrain his
sympathy and admiration. rue, the man was a criminal. e had robbed a
bank of a hundred thousand dollars. ut, after all, what was that hey
would probably have wasted the money in foolishness. And, anyway, a
bank which couldnt take care of its money deserved to lose it.

Mr irdsey felt almost a righteous glow of indignation against the ew
Asiatic ank.

e broke the silence which had followed enyons words with a
peculiarly immoral remark

Well, its lucky its only us thats recognized you, he said.

Waterall stared. Are you proposing that we should hush this thing up,
Mr irdsey he said coldly.

h, well

Waterall rose and went to the telephone.

What are you going to do

Call up cotland Yard, of course. What did you think

ndoubtedly the young man was doing his duty as a citizen, yet it is to
be recorded that Mr irdsey eyed him with unmixed horror.

You cant You mustnt he cried.

I certainly shall.

utbutthis fellow came all that way to see the ballgame.

It seemed incredible to Mr irdsey that this aspect of the affair
should not be the one to strike everybody to the exclusion of all other
aspects.

You cant give him up. Its too raw.

es a convicted criminal.

es a fan. Why, say, hes the fan.

Waterall shrugged his shoulders, and walked to the telephone. enyon
spoke.

ne moment.

Waterall turned, and found himself looking into the muzzle of a small
pistol. e laughed.

I expected that. Wave it about all you want.

enyon rested his shaking hand on the edge of the table.

Ill shoot if you move.

You wont. You havent the nerve. heres nothing to you. Youre ust
a cheap crook, and thats all. You wouldnt find the nerve to pull that
trigger in a million years.

e took off the receiver.

Give me cotland Yard, he said.

e had turned his back to enyon. enyon sat motionless. hen, with a
thud, the pistol fell to the ground. he next moment enyon had broken
down. is face was buried in his arms, and he was a wreck of a man,
sobbing like a hurt child.

Mr irdsey was profoundly distressed. e sat tingling and helpless.
his was a nightmare.

Wateralls level voice spoke at the telephone.

Is this cotland Yard I am Waterall, of the ew York
Chronicle. Is Inspector arvis there Ask him to come to the
phone.... Is that you, arvis his is Waterall. Im speaking from the
avoy, Mr irdseys rooms. irdsey. isten, arvis. heres a man here
thats wanted by the American police. end someone here and get him.
enyon. obbed the ew Asiatic ank in ew York. Yes, youve a warrant
out for him, five years old.... All right.

e hung up the receiver. enyon sprang to his feet. e stood, shaking,
a pitiable sight. Mr irdsey had risen with him. hey stood looking at
Waterall.

Youskunk said Mr irdsey.

Im an American citizen, said Waterall, and I happen to have some
idea of a citizens duties. What is more, Im a newspaper man, and I
have some idea of my duty to my paper. Call me what you like, you wont
alter that.

Mr irdsey snorted.

Youre suffering from ingrowing sentimentality, Mr irdsey. hats
whats the matter with you. ust because this man has escaped ustice
for five years, you think he ought to be considered uit of the whole
thing.

utbut

I dont.

e took out his cigarette case. e was feeling a great deal more
strungup and nervous than he would have had the others suspect. e had
had a moment of very swift thinking before he had decided to treat that
ugly little pistol in a spirit of contempt. Its production had given
him a decided shock, and now he was suffering from reaction. As a
conseuence, because his nerves were strained, he lit his cigarette
very languidly, very carefully, and with an offensive superiority which
was to Mr irdsey the last straw.

hese things are matters of an instant. nly an infinitesimal fraction
of time elapsed between the spectacle of Mr irdsey, indignant but
inactive, and Mr irdsey berserk, seeing red, frankly and undisguisedly
running amok. he transformation took place in the space of time
reuired for the lighting of a match.

ven as the match gave out its flame, Mr irdsey sprang.

Aeons before, when the young blood ran swiftly in his veins and life
was all before him, Mr irdsey had played football. nce a footballer,
always a potential footballer, even to the grave. ime had removed the
flying tackle as a factor in Mr irdseys life. Wrath brought it back.
e dived at young Mr Wateralls neatly trousered legs as he had dived
at other legs, less neatly trousered, thirty years ago. hey crashed to
the floor together and with the crash came Mr irdseys shout

un un, you fool un

And, even as he clung to his man, breathless, bruised, feeling as if
all the world had dissolved in one vast explosion of dynamite, the door
opened, banged to, and feet fled down the passage.

Mr irdsey disentangled himself, and rose painfully. he shock had
brought him to himself. e was no longer berserk. e was a middleaged
gentleman of high respectability who had been behaving in a very
peculiar way.

Waterall, flushed and dishevelled, glared at him speechlessly. e
gulped. Are you crazy

Mr irdsey tested gingerly the mechanism of a leg which lay under
suspicion of being broken. elieved, he put his foot to the ground
again. e shook his head at Waterall. e was slightly crumpled, but he
achieved a manner of dignified reproof.

You shouldnt have done it, young man. It was raw work. h, yes, I
know all about that dutyofacitizen stuff. It doesnt go. here are
exceptions to every rule, and this was one of them. When a man risks
his liberty to come and root at a ballgame, youve got to hand it to
him. e isnt a crook. es a fan. And we exiled fans have got to stick
together.

Waterall was uivering with fury, disappointment, and the peculiar
unpleasantness of being treated by an elderly gentleman like a sack of
coals. e stammered with rage.

You damned old fool, do you realize what youve done he police will
be here in another minute.

et them come.

ut what am I to say to them What explanation can I give What story
can I tell them Cant you see what a hole youve put me in

omething seemed to click inside Mr irdseys soul. It was the berserk
mood vanishing and reason leaping back on to her throne. e was able
now to think calmly, and what he thought about filled him with a sudden
gloom.

Young man, he said, dont worry yourself. Youve got a cinch. Youve
only got to hand a story to the police. Any old tale will do for them.
Im the man with the really difficult obIve got to suare myself
with my wife




AC  C


e was black, but comely. bviously in reduced circumstances, he had
nevertheless contrived to retain a certain smartness, a certain
airwhat the rench call the tournure. or had poverty killed
in him the aristocrats instinct of personal cleanliness for even as
lizabeth caught sight of him he began to wash himself.

At the sound of her step he looked up. e did not move, but there was
suspicion in his attitude. he muscles of his back contracted, his eyes
glowed like yellow lamps against black velvet, his tail switched a
little, warningly.

lizabeth looked at him. e looked at lizabeth. here was a pause,
while he summed her up. hen he stalked towards her, and, suddenly
lowering his head, drove it vigorously against her dress. e permitted
her to pick him up and carry him into the hallway, where rancis, the
anitor, stood.

rancis, said lizabeth, does this cat belong to anyone here

o, miss. hat cats a stray, that cat is. I been trying to locate
that cats owner for days.

rancis spent his time trying to locate things. It was the one
recreation of his eventless life. ometimes it was a noise, sometimes a
lost letter, sometimes a piece of ice which had gone astray in the
dumbwaiterwhatever it was, rancis tried to locate it.

as he been round here long, then

I seen him snooping about a considerable time.

I shall keep him.

lack cats bring luck, said rancis sententiously.

I certainly shant obect to that, said lizabeth. he was feeling
that morning that a little luck would be a pleasing novelty. hings had
not been going very well with her of late. It was not so much that the
usual proportion of her manuscripts had come back with editorial
compliments from the magazine to which they had been sentshe accepted
that as part of the game what she did consider scurvy treatment at the
hands of fate was the fact that her own pet magazine, the one to which
she had been accustomed to fly for refuge, almost sure of a
welcomewhen coldly treated by all the othershad suddenly expired
with a low gurgle for want of public support. It was like losing a kind
and openhanded relative, and it made the addition of a black cat to
the household almost a necessity.

In her flat, the door closed, she watched her new ally with some
anxiety. e had behaved admirably on the ourney upstairs, but she
would not have been surprised, though it would have pained her, if he
had now proceeded to try to escape through the ceiling. Cats were so
emotional. owever, he remained calm, and, after padding silently about
the room for awhile, raised his head and uttered a crooning cry.

hats right, said lizabeth, cordially. If you dont see what you
want, ask for it. he place is yours.

he went to the icebox, and produced milk and sardines. here was
nothing finicky or affected about her guest. e was a good trencherman,
and he did not care who knew it. e concentrated himself on the
restoration of his tissues with the purposeful air of one whose last
meal is a dim memory. lizabeth, brooding over him like a rovidence,
wrinkled her forehead in thought.

oseph, she said at last, brightening thats your name. ow settle
down, and start being a mascot.

oseph settled down amazingly. y the end of the second day he was
conveying the impression that he was the real owner of the apartment,
and that it was due to his good nature that lizabeth was allowed the
run of the place. ike most of his species, he was an autocrat. e
waited a day to ascertain which was lizabeths favourite chair, then
appropriated it for his own. If lizabeth closed a door while he was in
a room, he wanted it opened so that he might go out if she closed it
while he was outside, he wanted it opened so that he might come in if
she left it open, he fussed about the draught. ut the best of us have
our faults, and lizabeth adored him in spite of his.

It was astonishing what a difference he made in her life. he was a
friendly soul, and until osephs arrival she had had to depend for
company mainly on the footsteps of the man in the flat across the way.
Moreover, the building was an old one, and it creaked at night. here
was a loose board in the passage which made burglar noises in the dark
behind you when you stepped on it on the way to bed and there were
funny scratching sounds which made you ump and hold your breath.
oseph soon put a stop to all that. With oseph around, a loose board
became a loose board, nothing more, and a scratching noise ust a plain
scratching noise.

And then one afternoon he disappeared.

aving searched the flat without finding him, lizabeth went to the
window, with the intention of making a birdseye survey of the street.
he was not hopeful, for she had ust come from the street, and there
had been no sign of him then.

utside the window was a broad ledge, running the width of the
building. It terminated on the left, in a shallow balcony belonging to
the flat whose front door faced hersthe flat of the young man whose
footsteps she sometimes heard. he knew he was a young man, because
rancis had told her so. is name, ames enshaw oyd, she had learned
from the same source.

n this shallow balcony, licking his fur with the tip of a crimson
tongue and generally behaving as if he were in his own backyard, sat
oseph.

oseph cried lizabethsurprise, oy, and reproach combining to
give her voice an almost melodramatic uiver.

e looked at her coldly. Worse, he looked at her as if she had been an
utter stranger. ulging with her meat and drink, he cut her dead and,
having done so, turned and walked into the next flat.

lizabeth was a girl of spirit. oseph might look at her as if she were
a saucerful of tainted milk, but he was her cat, and she meant to get
him back. he went out and rang the bell of Mr ames enshaw oyds
flat.

he door was opened by a shirtsleeved young man. e was by no means an
unsightly young man. Indeed, of his typethe roughhaired,
cleanshaven, suareawed typehe was a distinctly goodlooking young
man. ven though she was regarding him at the moment purely in the
light of a machine for returning strayed cats, lizabeth noticed that.

he smiled upon him. It was not the fault of this nicelooking young
man that his sittingroom window was open or that oseph was an
ungrateful little beast who should have no fish that night.

Would you mind letting me have my cat, please she said pleasantly.
e has gone into your sittingroom through the window.

e looked faintly surprised.

Your cat

My black cat, oseph. e is in your sittingroom.

Im afraid you have come to the wrong place. Ive ust left my
sittingroom, and the only cat there is my black cat, eginald.

ut I saw oseph go in only a minute ago.

hat was eginald.

or the first time, as one who examining a fair shrub abruptly
discovers that it is a stingingnettle, lizabeth realized the truth.
his was no innocent young man who stood before her, but the blackest
criminal known to criminologistsa stealer of other peoples cats. er
manner shot down to zero.

May I ask how long you have had your eginald

ince four oclock this afternoon.

id he come in through the window

Why, yes. ow you mention it, he did.

I must ask you to be good enough to give me back my cat, said
lizabeth, icily.

e regarded her defensively.

Assuming, he said, purely for the purposes of academic argument,
that your oseph is my eginald, couldnt we come to an agreement of
some sort et me buy you another cat. A dozen cats.

I dont want a dozen cats. I want oseph.

ine, fat, soft cats, he went on persuasively. ovely, affectionate
ersians and Angoras, and

f course, if you intend to steal oseph

hese are harsh words. Any lawyer will tell you that there are special
statutes regarding cats. o retain a stray cat is not a tort or a
misdemeanour. In the celebrated testcase of Wiggins v. luebody
it was established

Will you please give me back my cat

he stood facing him, her chin in the air and her eyes shining, and the
young man suddenly fell a victim to conscience.

ook here, he said, Ill throw myself on your mercy. I admit the cat
is your cat, and that I have no right to it, and that I am ust a
common sneakthief. ut consider. I had ust come back from the first
rehearsal of my first play and as I walked in at the door that cat
walked in at the window. Im as superstitious as a coon, and I felt
that to give him up would be euivalent to killing the play before ever
it was produced. I know it will sound absurd to you. You have no
idiotic superstitions. You are sane and practical. ut, in the
circumstances, if you could see your way to waiving your
rights

efore the wistfulness of his eye lizabeth capitulated. he felt uite
overcome by the revulsion of feeling which swept through her. ow she
had misudged him he had taken him for an ordinary soulless purloiner
of cats, a snapperup of cats at random and without reason and all the
time he had been reluctantly compelled to the act by this deep and
praiseworthy motive. All the unselfishness and love of sacrifice innate
in good women stirred within her.

Why, of course you mustnt let him go It would mean awful bad
luck.

ut how about you

ever mind about me. hink of all the people who are dependent on your
play being a success.

he young man blinked.

his is overwhelming, he said.

I had no notion why you wanted him. e was nothing to meat least,
nothing muchthat is to saywell, I suppose I was rather fond of
himbut he was notnot

ital

hats ust the word I wanted. e was ust company, you know.

avent you many friends

I havent any friends.

You havent any friends hat settles it. You must take him back.

I couldnt think of it.

f course you must take him back at once.

I really couldnt.

You must.

I wont.

ut, good gracious, how do you suppose I should feel, knowing that you
were all alone and that I had sneaked youryour ewe lamb, as it were

And how do you suppose I should feel if your play failed simply for
lack of a black cat

e started, and ran his fingers through his rough hair in an
overwrought manner.

olomon couldnt have solved this problem, he said. ow would it
beit seems the only possible way outif you were to retain a sort of
managerial right in him Couldnt you sometimes step across and chat
with himand me, incidentallyover here Im very nearly as lonesome
as you are. Chicago is my home. I hardly know a soul in ew York.

er solitary life in the big city had forced upon lizabeth the ability
to form instantaneous udgements on the men she met. he flashed a
glance at the young man and decided in his favour.

Its very kind of you, she said. I should love to. I want to hear
all about your play. I write myself, you know, in a very small way, so
a successful playwright is omeone to me.

I wish I were a successful playwright.

Well, you are having the first play you have ever written produced on
roadway. hats pretty wonderful.

Myes, said the young man. It seemed to lizabeth that he spoke
doubtfully, and this modesty consolidated the favourable impression she
had formed.

                                   

he gods are ust. or every ill which they inflict they also supply a
compensation. It seems good to them that individuals in big cities
shall be lonely, but they have so arranged that, if one of these
individuals does at last contrive to seek out and form a friendship
with another, that friendship shall grow more swiftly than the tepid
acuaintanceships of those on whom the icy touch of loneliness has
never fallen. Within a week lizabeth was feeling that she had known
this ames enshaw oyd all her life.

And yet there was a tantalizing incompleteness about his personal
reminiscences. lizabeth was one of those persons who like to begin a
friendship with a full statement of their position, their previous
life, and the causes which led up to their being in this particular
spot at this particular time. At their next meeting, before he had had
time to say much on his own account, she had told him of her life in
the small Canadian town where she had passed the early part of her
life of the rich and unexpected aunt who had sent her to college for
no particular reason that anyone could ascertain except that she
enoyed being unexpected of the legacy from this same aunt, far
smaller than might have been hoped for, but sufficient to send a
grateful lizabeth to ew York, to try her luck there of editors,
magazines, manuscripts refused or accepted, plots for stories of life
in general, as lived down where the Arch spans ifth Avenue and the
lighted cross of the udson shines by night on Washington uare.

Ceasing eventually, she waited for him to begin and he did not
beginnot, that is to say, in the sense the word conveyed to
lizabeth. e spoke briefly of college, still more briefly of
Chicagowhich city he appeared to regard with a distaste that made
ots attitude towards the Cities of the lain almost kindly by
comparison. hen, as if he had fulfilled the demands of the most
exacting inuisitor in the matter of personal reminiscence, he began to
speak of the play.

he only facts concerning him to which lizabeth could really have
sworn with a clear conscience at the end of the second week of their
acuaintance were that he was very poor, and that this play meant
everything to him.

he statement that it meant everything to him insinuated itself so
freuently into his conversation that it weighed on lizabeths mind
like a burden, and by degrees she found herself giving the play place
of honour in her thoughts over and above her own little ventures. With
this stupendous thing hanging in the balance, it seemed almost wicked
of her to devote a moment to wondering whether the editor of an evening
paper, who had half promised to give her the entrancing post of Adviser
to the ovelorn on his ournal, would fulfil that halfpromise.

At an early stage in their friendship the young man had told her the
plot of the piece and if he had not unfortunately forgotten several
important episodes and had to leap back to them across a gulf of one or
two acts, and if he had referred to his characters by name instead of
by such descriptions as the fellow whos in love with the girlnot
whatshisname but the other chapshe would no doubt have got that
mental halfelson on it which is such a help towards the proper
understanding of a fouract comedy. As it was, his precis had left her
a little vague but she said it was perfectly splendid, and he said did
she really think so. And she said yes, she did, and they were both
happy.

ehearsals seemed to prey on his spirits a good deal. e attended them
with the pathetic regularity of the young dramatist, but they appeared
to bring him little balm. lizabeth generally found him steeped in
gloom, and then she would postpone the recital, to which she had been
looking forward, of whatever little triumph she might have happened to
win, and devote herself to the task of cheering him up. If women were
wonderful in no other way, they would be wonderful for their genius for
listening to shop instead of talking it.

lizabeth was feeling more than a little proud of the way in which her
udgement of this young man was being ustified. ife in ohemian ew
York had left her decidedly wary of strange young men, not formally
introduced her faith in human nature had had to undergo much
straining. Wolves in sheeps clothing were common obects of the
wayside in her unprotected life and perhaps her chief reason for
appreciating this friendship was the feeling of safety which it gave
her.

heir relations, she told herself, were so splendidly unsentimental.
here was no need for that silent defensiveness which had come to seem
almost an inevitable accompaniment to dealings with the opposite sex.
ames oyd, she felt, she could trust and it was wonderful how
soothing the reflexion was.

And that was why, when the thing happened, it so shocked and frightened
her.

It had been one of their uiet evenings. f late they had fallen into
the habit of sitting for long periods together without speaking. ut it
had differed from other uiet evenings through the fact that
lizabeths silence hid a slight but welldefined feeling of inury.
sually she sat happy with her thoughts, but tonight she was ruffled.
he had a grievance.

hat afternoon the editor of the evening paper, whose angelic status
not even a bald head and an absence of wings and harp could conceal,
had definitely informed her that the man who had conducted the column
hitherto having resigned, the post of eloise Milton, official adviser
to readers troubled with affairs of the heart, was hers and he looked
to her to ustify the daring experiment of letting a woman handle so
responsible a ob. Imagine how apoleon felt after Austerlitz, picture
Colonel Goethale contemplating the last spadeful of dirt from the
anama Canal, try to visualize a suburban householder who sees a flower
emerging from the soil in which he has inserted a packet of guaranteed
seeds, and you will have some faint conception how lizabeth felt as
those golden words proceeded from that editors lips. or the moment
Ambition was sated. he years, rolling by, might perchance open out
other vistas but for the moment she was content.

Into ames oyds apartment she had walked, stepping on fleecy clouds
of rapture, to tell him the great news.

he told him the great news.

e said, Ah

here are many ways of saying Ah You can put oy, amazement, rapture
into it you can also make it sound as if it were a reply to a remark
on the weather. ames oyd made it sound ust like that. is hair was
rumpled, his brow contracted, and his manner absent. he impression he
gave lizabeth was that he had barely heard her. he next moment he was
deep in a recital of the misdemeanours of the actors now rehearsing for
his fouract comedy. he star had done this, the leading woman that,
the uvenile something else. or the first time lizabeth listened
unsympathetically.

he time came when speech failed ames oyd, and he sat back in his
chair, brooding. lizabeth, cross and wounded, sat in hers, nursing
oseph. And so, in a dim light, time flowed by.

ust how it happened she never knew. ne moment, peace the next chaos.
ne moment stillness the next, oseph hurtling through the air, all
claws and expletives, and herself caught in a clasp which shook the
breath from her.

ne can dimly reconstruct amess train of thought. e is in despair
things are going badly at the theatre, and life has lost its savour.
is eye, as he sits, is caught by lizabeths profile. It is a
prettyabove all, a soothingprofile. An almost painful
sentimentality sweeps over ames oyd. here she sits, his only friend
in this cruel city. If you argue that there is no necessity to spring
at your only friend and nearly choke her, you argue soundly the point
is well taken. ut ames oyd was beyond the reach of sound argument.
Much rehearsing had frayed his nerves to ribbons. ne may say that he
was not responsible for his actions.

hat is the case for ames. lizabeth, naturally, was not in a position
to take a wide and understanding view of it. All she knew was that ames
had played her false, abused her trust in him. or a moment, such was
the shock of the surprise, she was not conscious of indignationor,
indeed, of any sensation except the purely physical one of
semistrangulation. hen, flushed, and more bitterly angry than she
could ever have imagined herself capable of being, she began to
struggle. he tore herself away from him. Coming on top of her
grievance, this thing filled her with a sudden, very vivid hatred of
ames. At the back of her anger, feeding it, was the humiliating
thought that it was all her own fault, that by her presence there she
had invited this.

he groped her way to the door. omething was writhing and struggling
inside her, blinding her eyes, and robbing her of speech. he was only
conscious of a desire to be alone, to be back and safe in her own home.
he was aware that he was speaking, but the words did not reach her.
he found the door, and pulled it open. he felt a hand on her arm, but
she shook it off. And then she was back behind her own door, alone and
at liberty to contemplate at leisure the ruins of that little temple of
friendship which she had built up so carefully and in which she had
been so happy.

he broad fact that she would never forgive him was for a while her
only coherent thought. o this succeeded the determination that she
would never forgive herself. And having thus placed beyond the pale the
only two friends she had in ew York, she was free to devote herself
without hindrance to the task of feeling thoroughly lonely and
wretched.

he shadows deepened. Across the street a sort of bubbling explosion,
followed by a erky glare that shot athwart the room, announced the
lighting of the big arclamp on the opposite sidewalk. he resented
it, being in the mood for undiluted gloom but she had not the energy
to pull down the shade and shut it out. he sat where she was, thinking
thoughts that hurt.

he door of the apartment opposite opened. here was a single ring at
her bell. he did not answer it. here came another. he sat where she
was, motionless. he door closed again.

                                   

he days dragged by. lizabeth lost count of time. ach day had its
duties, which ended when you went to bed that was all she knewexcept
that life had become very grey and very lonely, far lonelier even than
in the time when ames oyd was nothing to her but an occasional sound
of footsteps.

f ames she saw nothing. It is not difficult to avoid anyone in ew
York, even when you live ust across the way.

                                   

It was lizabeths first act each morning, immediately on awaking, to
open her front door and gather in whatever lay outside it. ometimes
there would be mail and always, unless rancis, as he sometimes did,
got mixed and absentminded, the morning milk and the morning paper.

ne morning, some two weeks after that evening of which she tried not
to think, lizabeth, opening the door, found immediately outside it a
folded scrap of paper. he unfolded it.

  I am ust off to the theatre. Wont you wish me luck I feel sure
  it is going to be a hit. oseph is purring like a dynamo....

In the early morning the brain works sluggishly. or an instant
lizabeth stood looking at the words uncomprehendingly then, with a
leaping of the heart, their meaning came home to her. e must have left
this at her door on the previous night. he play had been produced And
somewhere in the folded interior of the morning paper at her feet must
be the opinion of ne in Authority concerning it

ramatic criticisms have this peculiarity, that if you are looking for
them, they burrow and hide like rabbits. hey dodge behind murders
they duck behind baseball scores they lie up snugly behind the Wall
treet news. It was a full minute before lizabeth found what she
sought, and the first words she read smote her like a blow.

In that vein of delightful facetiousness which so endears him to all
followers and perpetrators of the drama, the ne in Authority rent
and tore ames oyds play. e knocked ames oyds play down, and
kicked it he umped on it with large feet he poured cold water on it,
and chopped it into little bits. e merrily disembowelled ames oyds
play.

lizabeth uivered from head to foot. he caught at the doorpost to
steady herself. In a flash all her resentment had gone, wiped away and
annihilated like a mist before the sun. he loved him, and she knew now
that she had always loved him.

It took her two seconds to realize that the ne in Authority was a
miserable incompetent, incapable of recognizing merit when it was
displayed before him. It took her five minutes to dress. It took her a
minute to run downstairs and out to the newsstand on the corner of the
street. ere, with a lavishness which charmed and exhilarated the
proprietor, she bought all the other papers which he could supply.

Moments of tragedy are best described briefly. ach of the papers
noticed the play, and each of them damned it with uncompromising
heartiness. he criticisms varied only in tone. ne cursed with relish
and gusto another with a certain pity a third with a kind of wounded
superiority, as of one compelled against his will to speak of something
unspeakable but the meaning of all was the same. ames oyds play was
a hideous failure.

ack to the house sped lizabeth, leaving the organs of a free people
to be gathered up, smoothed, and replaced on the stand by the now more
than ever charmed proprietor. p the stairs she sped, and arriving
breathlessly at amess door rang the bell.

eavy footsteps came down the passage crushed, disheartened footsteps
footsteps that sent a chill to lizabeths heart. he door opened.
ames oyd stood before her, heavyeyed and haggard. In his eyes was
despair, and on his chin the blue growth of beard of the man from whom
the mailed fist of ate has smitten the energy to perform his morning
shave.

ehind him, littering the floor, were the morning papers and at the
sight of them lizabeth broke down.

h, immy, darling she cried and the next moment she was in his
arms, and for a space time stood still.

ow long afterwards it was she never knew but eventually ames oyd
spoke.

If youll marry me, he said hoarsely, I dont care a hang.

immy, darling said lizabeth, of course I will.

ast them, as they stood there, a black streak shot silently, and
disappeared out of the door. oseph was leaving the sinking ship.

et him go, the fraud, said lizabeth bitterly. I shall never
believe in black cats again.

ut ames was not of this opinion.

oseph has brought me all the luck I need.

ut the play meant everything to you.

It did then.

lizabeth hesitated.

immy, dear, its all right, you know. I know you will make a fortune
out of your next play, and Ive heaps for us both to live on till you
make good. We can manage splendidly on my salary from the vening
Chronicle.

What ave you got a ob on a ew York paper

Yes, I told you about it. I am doing eloise Milton. Why, whats the
matter

e groaned hollowly.

And I was thinking that you would come back to Chicago with me

ut I will. f course I will. What did you think I meant to do

What Give up a real ob in ew York e blinked. his isnt really
happening. Im dreaming.

ut, immy, are you sure you can get work in Chicago Wouldnt it be
better to stay on here, where all the managers are, and

e shook his head.

I think its time I told you about myself, he said. Am I sure I can
get work in Chicago I am, worse luck. arling, have you in your more
material moments ever toyed with a oyds remier reakfastausage or
kept body and soul together with a slice off a oyds xcelsior
omeCured am My father makes them, and the tragedy of my life is
that he wants me to help him at it. his was my position. I loathed the
family business as much as dad loved it. I had a notiona fool notion,
as it has turned outthat I could make good in the literary line. Ive
scribbled in a sort of way ever since I was in college. When the time
came for me to oin the firm, I put it to dad straight. I said, Give
me a chance, one good, suare chance, to see if the divine fire is
really there, or if somebody has ust turned on the alarm as a
practical oke. And we made a bargain. I had written this play, and we
made it a testcase. We fixed it up that dad should put up the money to
give it a roadway production. If it succeeded, all right Im the
young Gus homas, and may go ahead in the literary game. If its a
fizzle, off goes my coat, and I abandon pipedreams of literary
triumphs and start in as the guy who put the Co. in oyd  Co. Well,
events have proved that I am the guy, and now Im going to keep
my part of the bargain ust as suarely as dad kept his. I know uite
well that if I refused to play fair and chose to stick on here in ew
York and try again, dad would go on staking me. hats the sort of man
he is. ut I wouldnt do it for a million roadway successes. Ive had
my chance, and Ive foozled and now Im going back to make him happy
by being a real live member of the firm. And the ueer thing about it
is that last night I hated the idea, and this morning, now that Ive
got you, I almost look forward to it.

e gave a little shiver.

And yetI dont know. heres something rather gruesome still to my
nearartist soul in living in luxury on murdered piggies. ave you ever
seen them persuading a pig to play the stellar role in a oyd remier
reakfastausage Its pretty ghastly. hey string them up by their
hind legs, andbrrrr

ever mind, said lizabeth soothingly. erhaps they dont mind it
really.

Well, I dont know, said ames oyd, doubtfully. Ive watched them
at it, and Im bound to say they didnt seem any too well pleased.

ry not to think of it.

ery well, said ames dutifully.

here came a sudden shout from the floor above, and on the heels of it
a shockhaired youth in pyamas burst into the apartment.

ow what said ames. y the way, Miss errold, my fiancee Mr
riggsaul Axworthy riggs, sometimes known as the oy ovelist.
Whats troubling you, aul

Mr riggs was stammering with excitement.

immy, cried the oy ovelist, what do you think has happened A
black cat has ust come into my apartment. I heard him mewing outside
the door, and opened it, and he streaked in. And I started my new novel
last night ay, you do believe this thing of black cats
bringing luck, dont you

uck My lad, grapple that cat to your soul with hoops of steel. es
the greatest little luckbringer in ew York. e was boarding with me
till this morning.

henby ove I nearly forgot to askyour play was a hit I havent
seen the papers yet

Well, when you see them, dont read the notices. It was the worst
frost roadway has seen since Columbuss time.

utI dont understand.

ont worry. You dont have to. Go back and fill that cat with fish,
or shell be leaving you. I suppose you left the door open

My God said the oy ovelist, paling, and dashed for the door.

o you think oseph will bring him luck said lizabeth,
thoughtfully.

It depends what sort of luck you mean. oseph seems to work in devious
ways. If I know osephs methods, riggss new novel will be reected
by every publisher in the city and then, when he is sitting in his
apartment, wondering which of his razors to end himself with, there
will be a ring at the bell, and in will come the most beautiful girl in
the world, and thenwell, then, take it from me, he will be all
right.

e wont mind about the novel

ot in the least.

ot even if it means that he will have to go away and kill pigs and
things.

About the pig business, dear. Ive noticed a slight tendency in you to
let yourself get rather morbid about it. I know they string them up by
the hindlegs, and all that sort of thing but you must remember that a
pig looks at these things from a different standpoint. My belief is
that the pigs like it. ry not to think of it.

ery well, said lizabeth, dutifully.




 MAC  A GY ICMA


Crossing the hames by Chelsea ridge, the wanderer through ondon
finds himself in pleasant attersea. ounding the ark, where the
female of the species wanders with its young by the ornamental water
where the wildfowl are, he comes upon a vast road. ne side of this is
given up to ature, the other to Intellect. n the right, green trees
stretch into the middle distance on the left, endless blocks of
residential flats. It is attersea ark oad, the home of the
cliffdwellers.

oliceconstable limmers beat embraced the first uarter of a mile of
the cliffs. It was his duty to pace in the measured fashion of the
ondon policeman along the front of them, turn to the right, turn to
the left, and come back along the road which ran behind them. In this
way he was enabled to keep the kings peace over no fewer than four
blocks of mansions.

It did not reuire a deal of keeping. attersea may have its tough
citizens, but they do not live in attersea ark oad. attersea ark
oads speciality is rain, not Crime. Authors, musicians, newspaper
men, actors, and artists are the inhabitants of these mansions. A child
could control them. hey assault and batter nothing but pianos they
steal nothing but ideas they murder nobody except Chopin and
eethoven. ot through these shall an ambitious young constable achieve
promotion.

At this conclusion dward limmer arrived within fortyeight hours of
his installation. e recognized the flats for what they wereust so
many layers of bigbrained blamelessness. And there was not even the
chance of a burglary. o burglar wastes his time burgling authors.
Constable limmer reconciled his mind to the fact that his term in
attersea must be looked on as something in the nature of a vacation.

e was not altogether sorry. At first, indeed, he found the new
atmosphere soothing. is last beat had been in the heart of tempestuous
Whitechapel, where his arms had ached from the incessant hauling of
wiry inebriates to the station, and his shins had revolted at the kicks
showered upon them by haughty spirits impatient of restraint. Also, one
aturday night, three friends of a gentleman whom he was trying to
induce not to murder his wife had so wrought upon him that, when he
came out of hospital, his already homely appearance was further marred
by a nose which resembled the gnarled root of a tree. All these things
had taken from the charm of Whitechapel, and the cloistral peace of
attersea ark oad was grateful and comforting.

And ust when the unbroken calm had begun to lose its attraction and
dreams of action were once more troubling him, a new interest entered
his life and with its coming he ceased to wish to be removed from
attersea. e fell in love.

It happened at the back of York Mansions. Anything that ever happened,
happened there for it is at the back of these blocks of flats that the
real life is. At the front you never see anything, except an occasional
tousleheaded young man smoking a pipe but at the back, where the
cooks come out to parley with the tradesmen, there is at certain hours
of the day uite a respectable activity. ointed dialogues about
yesterdays eggs and the toughness of aturdays meat are conducted
fortissimo between cheerful youths in the road and satirical
young women in print dresses, who come out of their kitchen doors on to
little balconies. he whole thing has a pleasing omeo and uliet
touch. omeo rattles up in his cart. ixtyfour he cries.
ixtyfower, sixtyfower, sixtyfow he kitchen door opens, and
uliet emerges. he eyes omeo without any great show of affection.
Are you erkins and lissett she inuires coldly. omeo admits it.
wo of them yesterdays eggs was bad. omeo protests. e defends his
eggs. hey were fresh from the hen he stood over her while she laid
them. uliet listens frigidly. I dont think, she says. Well,
half of sugar, one marmalade, and two of breakfast bacon, she adds,
and ends the argument. here is a rattling as of a steamer weighing
anchor the goods go up in the tradesmans lift uliet collects them,
and exits, banging the door. he little drama is over.

uch is life at the back of York Mansionsa busy, throbbing thing.

he peace of afternoon had fallen upon the world one day towards the
end of Constable limmers second week of the simple life, when his
attention was attracted by a whistle. It was followed by a musical
i

Constable limmer looked up. n the kitchen balcony of a secondfloor
flat a girl was standing. As he took her in with a slow and exhaustive
gaze, he was aware of strange thrills. here was something about this
girl which excited Constable limmer. I do not say that she was a
beauty I do not claim that you or I would have raved about her I
merely say that Constable limmer thought she was All ight.

Miss he said.

Got the time about you said the girl. All the clocks have stopped.

he time, said Constable limmer, consulting his watch, wants
exactly ten minutes to four.

hanks.

ot at all, miss.

he girl was inclined for conversation. It was that gracious hour of
the day when you have cleared lunch and havent got to think of dinner
yet, and have a bit of time to draw a breath or two. he leaned over
the balcony and smiled pleasantly.

If you want to know the time, ask a pleeceman, she said. You been on
this beat long

ust short of two weeks, miss.

I been here three days.

I hope you like it, miss.

oso. he milkmans a nice boy.

Constable limmer did not reply. e was busy silently hating the
milkman. e knew himone of those goodlooking blighters one of those
oiled and curled perishers one of those blooming fascinators who go
about the world making things hard for ugly, honest men with loving
hearts. h, yes, he knew the milkman.

es a rare one with his okes, said the girl.

Constable limmer went on not replying. e was perfectly aware that the
milkman was a rare one with his okes. e had heard him. he way girls
fell for anyone with the gift of the gabthat was what embittered
Constable limmer.

e she giggled. e calls me ittle ansyace.

If youll excuse me, miss, said Constable limmer coldly, Ill have
to be getting along on my beat.

ittle ansyace And you couldnt arrest him for it What a world
Constable limmer paced upon his way, a blueclad volcano.

It is a terrible thing to be obsessed by a milkman. o Constable
limmers disordered imagination it seemed that, dating from this
interview, the world became one solid milkman. Wherever he went, he
seemed to run into this milkman. If he was in the front road, this
milkmanAlf rooks, it appeared, was his loathsome namecame rattling
past with his ingling cans as if he were Apollo driving his chariot.
If he was round at the back, there was Alf, his damned tenor doing
duets with the balconies. And all this in defiance of the known law of
natural history that milkmen do not come out after five in the morning.
his irritated Constable limmer. You talk of a man going home with
the milk when you mean that he sneaks in in the small hours of the
morning. If all milkmen were like Alf rooks the phrase was
meaningless.

e brooded. he unfairness of ate was souring him. A man expects
trouble in his affairs of the heart from soldiers and sailors, and to
be cut out by even a postman is to fall before a worthy foe but
milkmenno nly grocers assistants and telegraphboys were intended
by rovidence to fear milkmen.

Yet here was Alf rooks, contrary to all rules, the established pet of
the mansions. right eyes shone from balconies when his Milkoooo
sounded. Golden voices giggled delightedly at his bellowed chaff. And
llen rown, whom he called ittle ansyace, was definitely in love
with him.

hey were keeping company. hey were walking out. his crushing truth
dward limmer learned from llen herself.

he had slipped out to mail a letter at the pillarbox on the corner,
and she reached it ust as the policeman arrived there in the course of
his patrol.

ervousness impelled Constable limmer to be arch.

llo, ullo, ullo, he said. osting loveletters

What, me his is to the olice Commissioner, telling him youre no
good.

Ill give it to him. im and me are taking supper tonight.

ature had never intended Constable limmer to be playful. e was at
his worst when he rollicked. e snatched at the letter with what was
meant to be a debonair gaiety, and only succeeded in looking like an
angry gorilla. he girl uttered a startled sueak.

he letter was addressed to Mr A. rooks.

layfulness, after this, was at a discount. he girl was frightened and
angry, and he was scowling with mingled ealousy and dismay.

o he said. o Mr A. rooks

llen rown was a nice girl, but she had a temper, and there were
moments when her manners lacked rather noticeably the repose which
stamps the caste of ere de ere.

Well, what about it she cried. Cant one write to the young
gentleman ones keeping company with, without having to get permission
from every he paused to marshal her forces from the assault.
Without having to get permission from every great, ugly, redfaced
copper with big feet and a broken nose in ondon

Constable limmers wrath faded into a dull unhappiness. Yes, she was
right. hat was the correct description. hat was how an impartial
cotland Yard would be compelled to describe him, if ever he got lost.
Missing. A great, ugly, redfaced copper with big feet and a broken
nose. hey would never find him otherwise.

erhaps you obect to my walking out with Alf erhaps youve got
something against him I suppose youre ealous

he threw in the last suggestion entirely in a sporting spirit. he
loved battle, and she had a feeling that this one was going to finish
far too uickly. o prolong it, she gave him this opening. here were a
dozen ways in which he might answer, each more insulting than the last
and then, when he had finished, she could begin again. hese little
encounters, she held, sharpened the wits, stimulated the circulation,
and kept one out in the open air.

Yes, said Constable limmer.

It was the one reply she was not expecting. or direct abuse, for
sarcasm, for dignity, for almost any speech beginning, What ealous
of you. Why she was prepared. ut this was incredible. It disabled
her, as the wild thrust of an unskilled fencer will disable a master of
the rapier. he searched in her mind and found that she had nothing to
say.

here was a tense moment in which she found him, looking her in the
eyes, strangely less ugly than she had supposed, and then he was gone,
rolling along on his beat with that air which all policemen must
achieve, of having no feelings at all, andas long as it behaves
itselfno interest in the human race.

llen posted her letter. he dropped it into the box thoughtfully, and
thoughtfully returned to the flat. he looked over her shoulder, but
Constable limmer was out of sight.

eaceful attersea began to vex Constable limmer. o a man crossed in
love, action is the one anodyne and attersea gave no scope for
action. e dreamed now of the old Whitechapel days as a man dreams of
the oys of his childhood. e reflected bitterly that a fellow never
knows when he is well off in this world. Any one of those myriad drunk
and disorderlies would have been as balm to him now. e was like a man
who has run through a fortune and in poverty eats the bread of regret.
Amazedly he recollected that in those happy days he had grumbled at his
lot. e remembered confiding to a friend in the stationhouse, as he
rubbed with liniment the spot on his right shin where the wellshod
foot of a oyous costermonger had got home, that this sort of
thingmeaning militant costermongerswas a bit too thick. A bit too
thick Why, he would pay one to kick him now. And as for the three
loyal friends of the wouldbe wifemurderer who had broken his nose, if
he saw them coming round the corner he would welcome them as brothers.

And attersea ark oad dozed oncalm, intellectual, lawabiding.

A friend of his told him that there had once been a murder in one of
these flats. e did not believe it. If any of these whitecorpuscled
clams ever swatted a fly, it was much as they could do. he thing was
ridiculous on the face of it. If they were capable of murder, they
would have murdered Alf rooks.

e stood in the road, and looked up at the placid buildings
resentfully.

Grrrrrr he growled, and kicked the sidewalk.

And, even as he spoke, on the balcony of a secondfloor flat there
appeared a woman, an elderly, sharpfaced woman, who waved her arms and
screamed, oliceman fficer Come up here Come up here at once

p the stone stairs went Constable limmer at the run. is mind was
alert and uestioning. Murder ardly murder, perhaps. If it had been
that, the woman would have said so. he did not look the sort of woman
who would be reticent about a thing like that. Well, anyway, it was
something and dward limmer had been long enough in attersea to be
thankful for small favours. An intoxicated husband would be better than
nothing. At least he would be something that a fellow could get his
hands on to and throw about a bit.

he sharpfaced woman was waiting for him at the door. e followed her
into the flat.

What is it, maam

heft ur cook has been stealing

he seemed sufficiently excited about it, but Constable limmer felt
only depression and disappointment. A stout admirer of the sex, he
hated arresting women. Moreover, to a man in the mood to tackle
anarchists with bombs, to be confronted with petty theft is galling.
ut duty was duty. e produced his notebook.

he is in her room. I locked her in. I know she has taken my brooch.
We have missed money. You must search her.

Cant do that, maam. emale searcher at the station.

Well, you can search her box.

A little, bald, nervous man in spectacles appeared as if out of a trap.
As a matter of fact, he had been there all the time, standing by the
bookcase but he was one of those men you do not notice till they move
and speak.

rane.

Well, enry

he little man seemed to swallow something.

II think that you may possibly be wronging llen. It is ust
possible, as regards the money e smiled in a ghastly manner and
turned to the policeman. rofficer, I ought to tell you that my
wifeahholds the pursestrings of our little home and it is ust
possible that in an absentminded moment I may have

o you mean to tell me, enry, that you have been taking my
money

My dear, it is ust possible that in the abs

ow often

e wavered perceptibly. Conscience was beginning to lose its grip.

h, not often.

ow often More than once

Conscience had shot its bolt. he little man gave up the truggle.

o, no, not more than once. Certainly not more than once.

You ought not to have done it at all. We will talk about that later.
It doesnt alter the fact that llen is a thief. I have missed money
half a dozen times. esides that, theres the brooch. tep this way,
officer.

Constable limmer stepped that wayhis face a mask. e knew who was
waiting for them behind the locked door at the end of the passage. ut
it was his duty to look as if he were stuffed, and he did so.

                                   

he was sitting on her bed, dressed for the street. It was her
afternoon out, the sharpfaced woman had informed Constable limmer,
attributing the fact that she had discovered the loss of the brooch in
time to stop her a direct interposition of rovidence. he was pale,
and there was a hunted look in her eyes.

You wicked girl, where is my brooch

he held it out without a word. he had been holding it in her hand.

You see, officer

I wasnt stealing of it. I adnt but borrowed it. I was going to put
it back.

tuff and nonsense orrow it, indeed What for

II wanted to look nice.

he woman gave a short laugh. Constable limmers face was a mere block
of wood, expressionless.

And what about the money Ive been missing I suppose youll say you
only borrowed that

I never took no money.

Well, its gone, and money doesnt go by itself. ake her to the
policestation, officer.

Constable limmer raised heavy eyes.

You make a charge, maam

less the man f course I make a charge. What did you think I asked
you to step in for

Will you come along, miss said Constable limmer.

                                   

ut in the street the sun shone gaily down on peaceful attersea. It
was the hour when children walk abroad with their nurses and from the
green depths of the ark came the sound of happy voices. A cat
stretched itself in the sunshine and eyed the two as they passed with
lazy content.

hey walked in silence. Constable limmer was a man with a rigid sense
of what was and what was not fitting behaviour in a policeman on duty
he aimed always at a machinelike impersonality. here were times when
it came hard, but he did his best. e strode on, his chin up and his
eyes averted. And beside him

Well, she was not crying. hat was something.

ound the corner, beautiful in light flannel, gay at both ends with a
new straw hat and the yellowest shoes in outhWest ondon, scented,
curled, a prince among young men, stood Alf rooks. e was feeling
piued. When he said three oclock, he meant three oclock. It was now
threefifteen, and she had not appeared. Alf rooks swore an impatient
oath, and the thought crossed his mind, as it had sometimes crossed it
before, that llen rown was not the only girl in the world.

Give her another five min

llen rown, with escort, at that moment turned the corner.

age was the first emotion which the spectacle aroused in Alf rooks.
Girls who kept a fellow waiting about while they fooled around with
policemen were no girls for him. hey could understand once and for all
that he was a man who could pick and choose.

And then an electric shock set the world dancing mistily before his
eyes. his policeman was wearing his belt he was on duty. And llens
face was not the face of a girl strolling with the orce for pleasure.

is heart stopped, and then began to race. is cheeks flushed a dusky
crimson. is aw fell, and a prickly warmth glowed in the parts about
his spine.

Goo

is fingers sought his collar.

Crumbs

e was hot all over.

Goo or hes been pinched

e tugged at his collar. It was choking him.

Alf rooks did not show up well in the first real crisis which life had
forced upon him. hat must be admitted. ater, when it was over, and he
had leisure for selfexamination, he admitted it to himself. ut even
then he excused himself by asking pace in a blustering manner what
else he could ha done. And if the uestion did not bring much balm to
his soul at the first time of asking, it proved wonderfully soothing on
constant repetition. e repeated it at intervals for the next two days,
and by the end of that time his cure was complete. n the third morning
his Milkoooo had regained its customary carefree ring, and he was
feeling that he had acted in difficult circumstances in the only
possible manner.

Consider. e was Alf rooks, well known and respected in the
neighbourhood a singer in the choir on undays owner of a milkwalk
in the most fashionable part of attersea to all practical purposes a
public man. Was he to recognize, in broad daylight and in open street,
a girl who walked with a policeman because she had to, a malefactor, a
girl who had been pinched

llen, Constable limmer woodenly at her side, came towards him. he
was ten yards offsevenfivethreeAlf rooks tilted his hat over
his eyes and walked past her, unseeing, a stranger.

e hurried on. e was conscious of a curious feeling that somebody was
ust going to kick him, but he dared not look round.

                                   

Constable limmer eyed the middle distance with an earnest gaze. is
face was redder than ever. eneath his blue tunic strange emotions were
at work. omething seemed to be filling his throat. e tried to swallow
it.

e stopped in his stride. he girl glanced up at him in a kind of dull,
uestioning way. heir eyes met for the first time that afternoon, and
it seemed to Constable limmer that whatever it was that was
interfering with the inside of his throat had grown larger, and more
unmanageable.

here was the misery of the stricken animal in her gaze. e had seen
women look like that in Whitechapel. he woman to whom, indirectly, he
owed his broken nose had looked like that. As his hand had fallen on
the collar of the man who was kicking her to death, he had seen her
eyes. hey were llens eyes, as she stood there nowtortured,
crushed, yet uncomplaining.

Constable limmer looked at llen, and llen looked at Constable
limmer. own the street some children were playing with a dog. In one
of the flats a woman began to sing.

op it, said Constable limmer.

e spoke gruffly. e found speech difficult.

he girl started.

What say

op it. Get along. un away.

What do you mean

Constable limmer scowled. is face was scarlet. is aw protruded like
a granite breakwater.

Go on, he growled. op it. ell him it was all a oke. Ill explain
at the station.

nderstanding seemed to come to her slowly.

o you mean Im to go

Yes.

What do you mean You arent going to take me to the station

o.

he stared at him. hen, suddenly, she broke down,

e wouldnt look at me. e was ashamed of me. e pretended not to see
me.

he leaned against the wall, her back shaking.

Well, run after him, and tell him it was all

o, no, no.

Constable limmer looked morosely at the sidewalk. e kicked it.

he turned. er eyes were red, but she was no longer crying. er chin
had a brave tilt.

I couldntnot after what he did. ets go along. II dont care.

he looked at him curiously.

Were you really going to have let me go

Constable limmer nodded. e was aware of her eyes searching his face,
but he did not meet them.

Why

e did not answer.

What would have happened to you, if you had have done

Constable limmers scowl was of the stuff of which nightmares are
made. e kicked the unoffending sidewalk with an increased
viciousness.

ismissed the orce, he said curtly.

And sent to prison, too, I shouldnt wonder.

Maybe.

e heard her draw a deep breath, and silence fell upon them again. he
dog down the road had stopped barking. he woman in the flat had
stopped singing. hey were curiously alone.

Would you have done all that for me she said.

Yes.

Why

ecause I dont think you ever did it. tole that money, I mean. or
the brooch, neither.

Was that all

What do you meanall

Was that the only reason

e swung round on her, almost threateningly.

o, he said hoarsely. o, it wasnt, and you know it wasnt. Well,
if you want it, you can have it. It was because I love you. here ow
Ive said it, and now you can go on and laugh at me as much as you
want.

Im not laughing, she said soberly.

You think Im a fool

o, I dont.

Im nothing to you. es the fellow youre stuck on.

he gave a little shudder.

o.

What do you mean

Ive changed. he paused. I think I shall have changed more by the
time I come out.

Come out

Come out of prison.

Youre not going to prison.

Yes, I am.

I wont take you.

Yes, you will. hink Im going to let you get yourself in trouble like
that, to get me out of a fix ot much.

instant she stopped. hen she was walking on again, her chin tilted.

Constable limmer braced his ample feet against the stones, and turned
purple.

Miss, he said, Ill be there, if I have to sit up all night. he
first thing youll see when they open the doors is a great, ugly,
redfaced copper with big feet and a broken nose. And if youll say

halfway fond of someone who knows olly well youre the only girl

he looked past him at the lamp which hung, blue and forbidding, over
the station door.

A A  


Mr Meggss mind was made up. e was going to commit suicide.

here had been moments, in the interval which had elapsed between the
first inception of the idea and his present state of fixed
determination, when he had wavered. In these moments he had debated,
with amlet, the uestion whether it was nobler in the mind to suffer,
or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them. ut
all that was over now. e was resolved.

Mr Meggss point, the main plank, as it were, in his suicidal platform,
was that with him it was beside the uestion whether or not it was
nobler to suffer in the mind. he mind hardly entered into it at all.
What he had to decide was whether it was worth while putting up any
longer with the perfectly infernal pain in his stomach. or Mr Meggs
was a martyr to indigestion. As he was also devoted to the pleasures of
the table, life had become for him one long battle, in which, whatever
happened, he always got the worst of it.

e was sick of it. e looked back down the vista of the years, and
found therein no hope for the future. ne after the other all the
patent medicines in creation had failed him. miths upreme igestive
elletshe had given them a more than fair trial. lenkinsops iuid
ifeGiverhe had drunk enough of it to float a ship. erkinss
remier ainreventer, strongly recommended by the swordswallowing
lady at arnum and aileyshe had wallowed in it. And so on down the
list. is interior organism had simply sneered at the lot of them.

eath, where is thy sting thought Mr Meggs, and forthwith began to
make his preparations.

hose who have studied the matter say that the tendency to commit
suicide is greatest among those who have passed their fiftyfifth year,
and that the rate is twice as great for unoccupied males as for
occupied males. nhappy Mr Meggs, accordingly, got it, so to speak,
with both barrels. e was fiftysix, and he was perhaps the most
unoccupied adult to be found in the length and breadth of the nited
ingdom. e toiled not, neither did he spin. wenty years before, an
unexpected legacy had placed him in a position to indulge a natural
taste for idleness to the utmost. e was at that time, as regards his
professional life, a clerk in a rather obscure shipping firm. ut of
office hours he had a mild fondness for letters, which took the form of
meaning to read right through the hundred best books one day, but
actually contenting himself with the daily paper and an occasional
magazine.

uch was Mr Meggs at thirtysix. he necessity for working for a living
and a salary too small to permit of selfindulgence among the more
expensive and deleterious dishes on the bill of fare had up to that
time kept his digestion within reasonable bounds. ometimes he had
twinges more often he had none.

hen came the legacy, and with it Mr Meggs let himself go. e left
ondon and retired to his native village, where, with a rench cook and
a series of secretaries to whom he dictated at long intervals
occasional paragraphs of a book on ritish utterflies on which he
imagined himself to be at work, he passed the next twenty years. e
could afford to do himself well, and he did himself extremely well.
obody urged him to take exercise, so he took no exercise. obody
warned him of the perils of lobster and welsh rabbits to a man of
sedentary habits, for it was nobodys business to warn him. n the
contrary, people rather encouraged the lobster side of his character,
for he was a hospitable soul and liked to have his friends dine with
him. he result was that ature, as is her wont, laid for him, and got
him. It seemed to Mr Meggs that he woke one morning to find himself a
chronic dyspeptic. hat was one of the hardships of his position, to
his mind. he thing seemed to hit him suddenly out of a blue sky. ne
moment, all appeared to be peace and oy the next, a lively and
irritable wildcat with redhot claws seemed somehow to have introduced
itself into his interior.

o Mr Meggs decided to end it.

In this crisis of his life the old methodical habits of his youth
returned to him. A man cannot be a clerk in even an obscure firm of
shippers for a great length of time without acuiring system, and Mr
Meggs made his preparations calmly and with a forethought worthy of a
better cause.

And so we find him, one glorious une morning, seated at his desk,
ready for the end.

utside, the sun beat down upon the orderly streets of the village.
ogs dozed in the warm dust. Men who had to work went about their toil
moistly, their minds far away in shady publichouses.

ut Mr Meggs, in his study, was cool both in mind and body.

efore him, on the desk, lay six little slips of paper. hey were
banknotes, and they represented, with the exception of a few pounds,
his entire worldly wealth. eside them were six letters, six envelopes,
and six postage stamps. Mr Meggs surveyed them calmly.

e would not have admitted it, but he had had a lot of fun writing
those letters. he deliberation as to who should be his heirs had
occupied him pleasantly for several days, and, indeed, had taken his
mind off his internal pains at times so thoroughly that he had
freuently surprised himself in an almost cheerful mood. Yes, he would
have denied it, but it had been great sport sitting in his armchair,
thinking whom he should pick out from nglands teeming millions to
make happy with his money. All sorts of schemes had passed through his
mind. e had a sense of power which the mere possession of the money
had never given him. e began to understand why millionaires make freak
wills. At one time he had toyed with the idea of selecting someone at
random from the ondon irectory and bestowing on him all he had to
beueath. e had only abandoned the scheme when it occurred to him that
he himself would not be in a position to witness the recipients
stunned delight. And what was the good of starting a thing like that,
if you were not to be in at the finish

entiment succeeded whimsicality. is old friends of the officethose
were the men to benefit. What good fellows they had been ome were
dead, but he still kept intermittently in touch with half a dozen of
them. Andan important pointhe knew their present addresses.

his point was important, because Mr Meggs had decided not to leave a
will, but to send the money direct to the beneficiaries. e knew what
wills were. ven in uite straightforward circumstances they often made
trouble. here had been some slight complication about his own legacy
twenty years ago. omebody had contested the will, and before the thing
was satisfactorily settled the lawyers had got away with about twenty
per cent of the whole. o, no wills. If he made one, and then killed
himself, it might be upset on a plea of insanity. e knew of no
relative who might consider himself entitled to the money, but there
was the chance that some remote cousin existed and then the comrades
of his youth might fail to collect after all.

e declined to run the risk. uietly and by degrees he had sold out the
stocks and shares in which his fortune was invested, and deposited the
money in his ondon bank. ix piles of large notes, dividing the total
into six eual parts six letters couched in a strain of reminiscent
pathos and manly resignation six envelopes, legibly addressed six
postagestamps and that part of his preparations was complete. e
licked the stamps and placed them on the envelopes took the notes and
inserted them in the letters folded the letters and thrust them into
the envelopes sealed the envelopes and unlocking the drawer of his
desk produced a small, black, uglylooking bottle.

e opened the bottle and poured the contents into a medicineglass.

It had not been without considerable thought that Mr Meggs had decided
upon the method of his suicide. he knife, the pistol, the ropethey
had all presented their charms to him. e had further examined the
merits of drowning and of leaping to destruction from a height.

here were flaws in each. ither they were painful, or else they were
messy. Mr Meggs had a tidy soul, and he revolted from the thought of
spoiling his figure, as he would most certainly do if he drowned
himself or the carpet, as he would if he used the pistol or the
pavementand possibly some innocent pedestrian, as must infallibly
occur should he leap off the Monument. he knife was out of the
uestion. Instinct told him that it would hurt like the very dickens.

o poison was the thing. asy to take, uick to work, and on the whole
rather agreeable than otherwise.

Mr Meggs hid the glass behind the inkpot and rang the bell.

as Miss illenger arrived he inuired of the servant.

he has ust come, sir.

ell her that I am waiting for her here.

ane illenger was an institution. er official position was that of
private secretary and typist to Mr Meggs. hat is to say, on the rare
occasions when Mr Meggss conscience overcame his indolence to the
extent of forcing him to resume work on his ritish utterflies, it was
to Miss illenger that he addressed the few rambling and incoherent
remarks which constituted his idea of a regular hard, slogging spell of
literary composition. When he sank back in his chair, speechless and
exhausted like a Marathon runner who has started his sprint a mile or
two too soon, it was Miss illengers task to unscramble her shorthand
notes, type them neatly, and place them in their special drawer in the
desk.

Miss illenger was a wary spinster of austere views, uncertain age, and
a deeprooted suspicion of mena suspicion which, to do an abused sex
ustice, they had done nothing to foster. Men had always been almost
coldly correct in their dealings with Miss illenger. In her twenty
years of experience as a typist and secretary she had never had to
refuse with scorn and indignation so much as a box of chocolates from
any of her employers. evertheless, she continued to be icily on her
guard. he clenched fist of her dignity was always drawn back, ready to
swing on the first male who dared to step beyond the bounds of
professional civility.

uch was Miss illenger. he was the last of a long line of unprotected
nglish girlhood which had been compelled by straitened circumstances
to listen for hire to the appallingly dreary nonsense which Mr Meggs
had to impart on the subect of ritish utterflies. Girls had come,
and girls had gone, blondes, exblondes, brunettes, exbrunettes,
nearblondes, nearbrunettes they had come buoyant, full of hope and
life, tempted by the lavish salary which Mr Meggs had found himself
after a while compelled to pay and they had dropped off, one after
another, like exhausted bivalves, unable to endure the crushing boredom
of life in the village which had given Mr Meggs to the world. or Mr
Meggss hometown was no City of leasure. emove the icars
magiclantern and the tryyourweight machine opposite the post office,
and you practically eliminated the temptations to tread the primrose
path. he only young men in the place were silent, gaping youths, at
whom lunacy commissioners looked sharply and suspiciously when they
met. he tango was unknown, and the onestep. he only form of dance
extantand that only at the rarest intervalswas a sort of polka not
unlike the movements of a slightly inebriated boxing kangaroo. Mr
Meggss secretaries and typists gave the town one startled, horrified
glance, and stampeded for ondon like frightened ponies.

ot so Miss illenger. he remained. he was a business woman, and it
was enough for her that she received a good salary. or five pounds a
week she would have undertaken a post as secretary and typist to a
olar xpedition. or six years she had been with Mr Meggs, and
doubtless she looked forward to being with him at least six years more.

erhaps it was the pathos of this thought which touched Mr Meggs, as
she sailed, notebook in hand, through the doorway of the study. ere,
he told himself, was a confiding girl, all unconscious of impending
doom, relying on him as a daughter relies on her father. e was glad
that he had not forgotten Miss illenger when he was making his
preparations.

e had certainly not forgotten Miss illenger. n his desk beside the
letters lay a little pile of notes, amounting in all to five hundred
poundsher legacy.

Miss illenger was always businesslike. he sat down in her chair,
opened her notebook, moistened her pencil, and waited expectantly for
Mr Meggs to clear his throat and begin work on the butterflies. he was
surprised when, instead of frowning, as was his invariable practice
when bracing himself for composition, he bestowed upon her a sweet,
slow smile.

All that was maidenly and defensive in Miss illenger leaped to arms
under that smile. It ran in and out among her nervecentres. It had
been long in arriving, this moment of crisis, but here it undoubtedly
was at last. After twenty years an employer was going to court disaster
by trying to flirt with her.

Mr Meggs went on smiling. You cannot classify smiles. othing lends
itself so much to a variety of interpretations as a smile. Mr Meggs
thought he was smiling the sad, tender smile of a man who, knowing
himself to be on the brink of the tomb, bids farewell to a faithful
employee. Miss illengers view was that he was smiling like an
abandoned old rip who ought to have been ashamed of himself.

o, Miss illenger, said Mr Meggs, I shall not work this morning. I
shall want you, if you will be so good, to post these six letters for
me.

Miss illenger took the letters. Mr Meggs surveyed her tenderly.

Miss illenger, you have been with me a long time now. ix years, is
it not ix years. Well, well. I dont think I have ever made you a
little present, have I

You give me a good salary.

Yes, but I want to give you something more. ix years is a long time.
I have come to regard you with a different feeling from that which the
ordinary employer feels for his secretary. You and I have worked
together for six long years. urely I may be permitted to give you some
token of my appreciation of your fidelity. e took the pile of notes.
hese are for you, Miss illenger.

e rose and handed them to her. e eyed her for a moment with all the
sentimentality of a man whose digestion has been out of order for over
two decades. he pathos of the situation swept him away. e bent over
Miss illenger, and kissed her on the forehead.

miles excepted, there is nothing so hard to classify as a kiss. Mr
Meggss notion was that he kissed Miss illenger much as some great
general, wounded unto death, might have kissed his mother, his sister,
or some particularly sympathetic aunt Miss illengers view, differing
substantially from this, may be outlined in her own words.

Ah she cried, as, dealing Mr Meggss conveniently placed aw a blow
which, had it landed an inch lower down, might have knocked him out,
she sprang to her feet. ow dare you Ive been waiting for this Mr
Meggs. I have seen it in your eye. I have expected it. et me tell you
that I am not at all the sort of girl with whom it is safe to behave
like that. I can protect myself. I am only a workinggirl

Mr Meggs, who had fallen back against the desk as a stricken pugilist
falls on the ropes, pulled himself together to protest.

Miss illenger, he cried, aghast, you misunderstand me. I had no
intention

Misunderstand you ah I am only a workinggirl

othing was farther from my mind

Indeed othing was farther from your mind You give me money, you
shower your vile kisses on me, but nothing was farther from your mind
than the obvious interpretation of such behaviour efore coming to Mr
Meggs, Miss illenger had been secretary to an Indiana novelist. he
had learned style from the master. ow that you have gone too far, you
are frightened at what you have done. You well may be, Mr Meggs. I am
only a workinggirl

Miss illenger, I implore you

ilence I am only a workinggirl

A wave of mad fury swept over Mr Meggs. he shock of the blow and still
more of the frightful ingratitude of this horrible woman nearly made
him foam at the mouth.

ont keep on saying youre only a workinggirl, he bellowed. Youll
drive me mad. Go. Go away from me. Get out. Go anywhere, but leave me
alone

Miss illenger was not entirely sorry to obey the reuest. Mr Meggss
sudden fury had startled and frightened her. o long as she could end
the scene victorious, she was anxious to withdraw.

Yes, I will go, she said, with dignity, as she opened the door. ow
that you have revealed yourself in your true colours, Mr Meggs, this
house is no fit place for a wor

he caught her employers eye, and vanished hastily.

Mr Meggs paced the room in a ferment. e had been shaken to his core by
the scene. e boiled with indignation. hat his kind thoughts should
have been so misinterpretedit was too much. f all ungrateful worlds,
this world was the most

e stopped suddenly in his stride, partly because his shin had struck a
chair, partly because an idea had struck his mind.

opping madly, he added one more parallel between himself and amlet by
solilouizing aloud.

Ill be hanged if I commit suicide, he yelled.

And as he spoke the words a curious peace fell on him, as on a man who
has awakened from a nightmare. e sat down at the desk. What an idiot
he had been ever to contemplate selfdestruction. What could have
induced him to do it y his own hand to remove himself, merely in
order that a pack of ungrateful brutes might wallow in his moneyit
was the scheme of a perfect fool.

e wouldnt commit suicide. ot if he knew it. e would stick on and
laugh at them. And if he did have an occasional pain inside, what of
that apoleon had them, and look at him. e would be blowed if he
committed suicide.

With the fire of a new resolve lighting up his eyes, he turned to seize
the six letters and rifle them of their contents.

hey were gone.

It took Mr Meggs perhaps thirty seconds to recollect where they had
gone to, and then it all came back to him. e had given them to the
demon illenger, and, if he did not overtake her and get them back, she
would mail them.

f all the mixed thoughts which seethed in Mr Meggss mind at that
moment, easily the most prominent was the reflection that from his
front door to the post office was a walk of less than five minutes.

                                   

Miss illenger walked down the sleepy street in the une sunshine,
boiling, as Mr Meggs had done, with indignation. he, too, had been
shaken to the core. It was her intention to fulfil her duty by posting
the letters which had been entrusted to her, and then to uit for ever
the service of one who, for six years a model employer, had at last
forgotten himself and showed his true nature.

er meditations were interrupted by a hoarse shout in her rear and,
turning, she perceived the model employer running rapidly towards her.
is face was scarlet, his eyes wild, and he wore no hat.

Miss illengers mind worked swiftly. he took in the situation in a
flash. nreuited, guilty love had sapped Mr Meggss reason, and she
was to be the victim of his fury. he had read of scores of similar
cases in the newspapers. ow little she had ever imagined that she
would be the heroine of one of these dramas of passion.

he looked for one brief instant up and down the street. obody was in
sight. With a loud cry she began to run.

It was the fierce voice of her pursuer. Miss illenger increased to
third speed. As she did so, she had a vision of headlines.

spectacle of a hatless gentleman with a purple face pursuing his
secretary through the streets at a rapid gallop would, of course, have
excited little, if any, remark. ut in Mr Meggss hometown events were
of rarer occurrence. he last milestone in the history of his native
place had been the visit, two years before, of ingleys tupendous
Circus, which had paraded along the main street on its way to the next
town, while zealous members of its staff visited the back premises of
the houses and removed all the washing from the lines. ince then deep
peace had reigned.

Gradually, therefore, as the chase warmed up, citizens of all shapes
and sizes began to assemble. Miss illengers screams and the general
appearance of Mr Meggs gave food for thought. aving brooded over the
situation, they decided at length to take a hand, with the result that
as Mr Meggss grasp fell upon Miss illenger the grasp of several of
his fellowtownsmen fell upon him.

ave me said Miss illenger.

Mr Meggs pointed speechlessly to the letters, which she still grasped
in her right hand. e had taken practically no exercise for twenty
years, and the pace had told upon him.

Constable Gooch, guardian of the towns welfare, tightened his hold on
Mr Meggss arm, and desired explanations.

ehe was going to murder me, said Miss illenger.

ill him, advised an austere bystander.

What do you mean you were going to murder the lady inuired
Constable Gooch.

Mr Meggs found speech.

IIII only wanted those letters.

What for

heyre mine.

You charge her with stealing em

e gave them me to post with his own hands, cried Miss illenger.

I know I did, but I want them back.

y this time the constable, though age had to some extent dimmed his
sight, had recognized beneath the perspiration, features which, though
they were distorted, were nevertheless those of one whom he respected
as a leading citizen.

Why, Mr Meggs he said.

his identification by one in authority calmed, if it a little
disappointed, the crowd. What it was they did not know, but, it was
apparently not a murder, and they began to drift off.

Why dont you give Mr Meggs his letters when he asks you, maam said
the constable.

Miss illenger drew herself up haughtily.

ere are your letters, Mr Meggs, I hope we shall never meet again.

Mr Meggs nodded. hat was his view, too.

All things work together for good. he following morning Mr Meggs awoke
from a dreamless sleep with a feeling that some curious change had
taken place in him. e was abominably stiff, and to move his limbs was
pain, but down in the centre of his being there was a novel sensation
of lightness. e could have declared that he was happy.

Wincing, he dragged himself out of bed and limped to the window. e
threw it open. It was a perfect morning. A cool breeze smote his face,
bringing with it pleasant scents and the soothing sound of Gods
creatures beginning a new day.

An astounding thought struck him.

Why, I feel well

hen another.

It must be the exercise I took yesterday. y George, Ill do it
regularly.

e drank in the air luxuriously. Inside him, the wildcat gave him a
sudden claw, but it was a halfhearted effort, the effort of one who
knows that he is beaten. Mr Meggs was so absorbed in his thoughts that
he did not even notice it.

ondon, he was saying to himself. ne of these physical culture
places.... Comparatively young man.... ut myself in their hands....
Mild, regular exercise....

e limped to the bathroom.




 MA WI W  


tudents of the folklore of the nited tates of America are no doubt
familiar with the uaint old story of Clarence Macadden. Clarence
Macadden, it seems, was wishful to dance, but his feet wasnt gaited
that way. o he sought a professor and asked him his price, and said he
was willing to pay. he professor the legend goes on looked down
with alarm at his feet and marked their enormous expanse and he tacked
on a five to his regular price for teaching Macadden to dance.

I have often been struck by the close similarity between the case of
Clarence and that of enry Wallace Mills. ne difference alone presents
itself. It would seem to have been mere vanity and ambition that
stimulated the former whereas the motive force which drove enry Mills
to defy ature and attempt dancing was the purer one of love. e did it
to please his wife. ad he never gone to Ye onnie riarush arm,
that popular holiday resort, and there met Minnie ill, he would
doubtless have continued to spend in peaceful reading the hours not
given over to work at the ew York bank at which he was employed as
payingcashier. or enry was a voracious reader. is idea of a
pleasant evening was to get back to his little flat, take off his coat,
put on his slippers, light a pipe, and go on from the point where he
had left off the night before in his perusal of the ICA volume of
the ncyclopaedia ritannicamaking notes as he read in a stout
notebook. e read the ICA volume because, after many days, he had
finished the AA, AA, and the AI. here was something
admirableand yet a little horribleabout enrys method of study. e
went after earning with the cold and dispassionate relentlessness of a
stoat pursuing a rabbit. he ordinary man who is paying instalments on
the ncyclopaedia ritannica is apt to get overexcited and to
skip impatiently to olume III YM to see how it all comes out
in the end. ot so enry. is was not a frivolous mind. e intended to
read the ncyclopaedia through, and he was not going to spoil
his pleasure by peeping ahead.

It would seem to be an inexorable law of ature that no man shall shine
at both ends. If he has a high forehead and a thirst for wisdom, his
foxtrotting if any shall be as the staggerings of the drunken
while, if he is a good dancer, he is nearly always petrified from the
ears upward. o better examples of this law could have been found than
enry Mills and his fellowcashier, idney Mercer. In ew York banks
payingcashiers, like bears, tigers, lions, and other fauna, are always
shut up in a cage in pairs, and are conseuently dependent on each
other for entertainment and social intercourse when business is slack.
enry Mills and idney simply could not find a subect in common.
idney knew absolutely nothing of even such elementary things as Abana,
Aberration, Abraham, or Acrogenae while enry, on his side, was
scarcely aware that there had been any developments in the dance since
the polka. It was a relief to enry when idney threw up his ob to
oin the chorus of a musical comedy, and was succeeded by a man who,
though full of limitations, could at least converse intelligently on
owls.

uch, then, was enry Wallace Mills. e was in the middle thirties,
temperate, studious, a moderate smoker, andone would have saida
bachelor of the bachelors, armourplated against Cupids wellmeant but
obsolete artillery. ometimes idney Mercers successor in the tellers
cage, a sentimental young man, would broach the topic of Woman and
Marriage. e would ask enry if he ever intended to get married. n
such occasions enry would look at him in a manner which was a blend of
scorn, amusement, and indignation and would reply with a single word

Me

It was the way he said it that impressed you.

ut enry had yet to experience the unmanning atmosphere of a lonely
summer resort. e had only ust reached the position in the bank where
he was permitted to take his annual vacation in the summer. itherto he
had always been released from his cage during the winter months, and
had spent his ten days of freedom at his flat, with a book in his hand
and his feet on the radiator. ut the summer after idney Mercers
departure they unleashed him in August.

It was meltingly warm in the city. omething in enry cried out for the
country. or a month before the beginning of his vacation he devoted
much of the time that should have been given to the ncyclopaedia
ritannica in reading summerresort literature. e decided at
length upon Ye onnie riarush arm because the advertisements spoke
so well of it.

Ye onnie riarush arm was a rather battered frame building many
miles from anywhere. Its attractions included a overs eap, a Grotto,
golflinksa fivehole course where the enthusiast found unusual
hazards in the shape of a number of goats tethered at intervals between
the holesand a silvery lake, only portions of which were used as a
dumpingground for tin cans and wooden boxes. It was all new and
strange to enry and caused him an odd exhilaration. omething of
gaiety and reckless abandon began to creep into his veins. e had a
curious feeling that in these romantic surroundings some adventure
ought to happen to him.

At this uncture Minnie ill arrived. he was a small, slim girl,
thinner and paler than she should have been, with large eyes that
seemed to enry pathetic and stirred his chivalry. e began to think a
good deal about Minnie ill.

And then one evening he met her on the shores of the silvery lake. e
was standing there, slapping at things that looked like mosuitoes, but
could not have been, for the advertisements expressly stated that none
were ever found in the neighbourhood of Ye onnie riarush arm, when
along she came. he walked slowly, as if she were tired. A strange
thrill, half of pity, half of something else, ran through enry. e
looked at her. he looked at him.

Good evening, he said.

hey were the first words he had spoken to her. he never contributed
to the dialogue of the diningroom, and he had been too shy to seek her
out in the open.

he said Good evening, too, tying the score. And there was silence
for a moment.

Commiseration overcame enrys shyness.

Youre looking tired, he said.

I feel tired. he paused. I overdid it in the city.

It

ancing.

h, dancing. id you dance much

Yes a great deal.

Ah

A promising, even a dashing start. ut how to continue or the first
time enry regretted the steady determination of his methods with the
ncyclopaedia. ow pleasant if he could have been in a position
to talk easily of ancing. hen memory reminded him that, though he had
not yet got up to ancing, it was only a few weeks before that he had
been reading of the allet.

I dont dance myself, he said, but I am fond of reading about it.
id you know that the word ballet incorporated three distinct modern
words, ballet, ball, and ballad, and that balletdancing was
originally accompanied by singing

It hit her. It had her weak. he looked at him with awe in her eyes.
ne might almost say that she gaped at enry.

I hardly know anything, she said.

he first descriptive ballet seen in ondon, ngland, said enry,
uietly, was he avern ilkers, which was played at rury ane
inin seventeensomething.

Was it

And the earliest modern ballet on record was that given byby someone
to celebrate the marriage of the uke of Milan in .

here was no doubt or hesitation about the date this time. It was
grappled to his memory by hoops of steel owing to the singular
coincidence of it being also his telephone number. e gave it out with
a roll, and the girls eyes widened.

What an awful lot you know

h, no, said enry, modestly. I read a great deal.

It must be splendid to know a lot, she said, wistfully. Ive never
had time for reading. Ive always wanted to. I think youre wonderful

enrys soul was expanding like a flower and purring like a
welltickled cat. ever in his life had he been admired by a woman. he
sensation was intoxicating.

ilence fell upon them. hey started to walk back to the farm, warned
by the distant ringing of a bell that supper was about to materialize.
It was not a musical bell, but distance and the magic of this unusual
moment lent it charm. he sun was setting. It threw a crimson carpet
across the silvery lake. he air was very still. he creatures,
unclassified by science, who might have been mistaken for mosuitoes
had their presence been possible at Ye onnie riarush arm, were
biting harder than ever. ut enry heeded them not. e did not even
slap at them. hey drank their fill of his blood and went away to put
their friends on to this good thing but for enry they did not exist.
trange things were happening to him. And, lying awake that night in
bed, he recognized the truth. e was in love.

After that, for the remainder of his stay, they were always together.
hey walked in the woods, they sat by the silvery lake. e poured out
the treasures of his learning for her, and she looked at him with
reverent eyes, uttering from time to time a soft Yes or a musical
Gee

In due season enry went back to ew York.

Youre dead wrong about love, Mills, said his sentimental
fellowcashier, shortly after his return. You ought to get married.

Im going to, replied enry, briskly. Week tomorrow.

Which stunned the other so thoroughly that he gave a customer who
entered at that moment fifteen dollars for a tendollar cheue, and had
to do some excited telephoning after the bank had closed.

enrys first year as a married man was the happiest of his life. e
had always heard this period described as the most perilous of
matrimony. e had braced himself for clashings of tastes, painful
adustments of character, sudden and unavoidable uarrels. othing of
the kind happened. rom the very beginning they settled down in perfect
harmony. he merged with his life as smoothly as one river oins
another. e did not even have to alter his habits. very morning he had
his breakfast at eight, smoked a cigarette, and walked to the
nderground. At five he left the bank, and at six he arrived home, for
it was his practice to walk the first two miles of the way, breathing
deeply and regularly. hen dinner. hen the uiet evening. ometimes
the movingpictures, but generally the uiet evening, he reading the
ncyclopaediaaloud nowMinnie darning his socks, but never
ceasing to listen.

ach day brought the same sense of grateful amazement that he should be
so wonderfully happy, so extraordinarily peaceful. verything was as
perfect as it could be. Minnie was looking a different girl. he had
lost her drawn look. he was filling out.

ometimes he would suspend his reading for a moment, and look across at
her. At first he would see only her soft hair, as she bent over her
sewing. hen, wondering at the silence, she would look up, and he would
meet her big eyes. And then enry would gurgle with happiness, and
demand of himself, silently

Can you beat it

It was the anniversary of their wedding. hey celebrated it in fitting
style. hey dined at a crowded and exhilarating Italian restaurant on a
street off eventh Avenue, where red wine was included in the bill, and
excitable people, probably extremely clever, sat round at small tables
and talked all together at the top of their voices. After dinner they
saw a musical comedy. And thenthe great event of the nightthey
went on to supper at a glittering restaurant near imes uare.

here was something about supper at an expensive restaurant which had
always appealed to enrys imagination. arnest devourer as he was of
the solids of literature, he had tasted from time to time its lighter
facethose novels which begin with the hero supping in the midst of
the glittering throng and having his attention attracted to a
distinguishedlooking elderly man with a grey imperial who is entering
with a girl so strikingly beautiful that the revellers turn, as she
passes, to look after her. And then, as he sits and smokes, a waiter
comes up to the hero and, with a soft ardon, msieu hands
him a note.

he atmosphere of Geisenheimers suggested all that sort of thing to
enry. hey had finished supper, and he was smoking a cigarhis second
that day. e leaned back in his chair and surveyed the scene. e felt
braced up, adventurous. e had that feeling, which comes to all uiet
men who like to sit at home and read, that this was the sort of
atmosphere in which he really belonged. he brightness of it allthe
dazzling lights, the music, the hubbub, in which the deepthroated
gurgle of the wineagent surprised while drinking soup blended with the
shriller note of the chorusgirl calling to her matethese things got
enry. e was thirtysix next birthday, but he felt a youngish
twentyone.

A voice spoke at his side. enry looked up, to perceive idney Mercer.

he passage of a year, which had turned enry into a married man, had
turned idney Mercer into something so magnificent that the spectacle
for a moment deprived enry of speech. aultless evening dress clung
with loving closeness to idneys lissom form. Gleaming shoes of
perfect patent leather covered his feet. is light hair was brushed
back into a smooth sleekness on which the electric lights shone like
stars on some beautiful pool. is practically chinless face beamed
amiably over a spotless collar.

enry wore blue serge.

What are you doing here, enry, old top said the vision. I didnt
know you ever came among the bright lights.

is eyes wandered off to Minnie. here was admiration in them, for
Minnie was looking her prettiest.

Wife, said enry, recovering speech. And to Minnie Mr Mercer. ld
friend.

o youre married Wish you luck. ows the bank

enry said the bank was doing as well as could be expected.

You still on the stage

Mr Mercer shook his head importantly.

Got better ob. rofessional dancer at this show. olling in money.
Why arent you dancing

he words struck a arring note. he lights and the music until that
moment had had a subtle psychological effect on enry, enabling him to
hypnotize himself into a feeling that it was not inability to dance
that kept him in his seat, but that he had had so much of that sort of
thing that he really preferred to sit uietly and look on for a change.
idneys uestion changed all that. It made him face the truth.

I dont dance.

or the love of Mike I bet Mrs Mills does. Would you care for a turn,
Mrs Mills

o, thank you, really.

ut remorse was now at work on enry. e perceived that he had been
standing in the way of Minnies pleasure. f course she wanted to
dance. All women did. he was only refusing for his sake.

onsense, Min. Go to it.

Minnie looked doubtful.

f course you must dance, Min. I shall be all right. Ill sit here and
smoke.

he next moment Minnie and idney were treading the complicated
measure and simultaneously enry ceased to be a youngish twentyone
and was even conscious of a fleeting doubt as to whether he was really
only thirtyfive.

oil the whole uestion of old age down, and what it amounts to is that
a man is young as long as he can dance without getting lumbago, and, if
he cannot dance, he is never young at all. his was the truth that
forced itself upon enry Wallace Mills, as he sat watching his wife
moving over the floor in the arms of idney Mercer. ven he could see
that Minnie danced well. e thrilled at the sight of her gracefulness
and for the first time since his marriage he became introspective. It
had never struck him before how much younger Minnie was than himself.
When she had signed the paper at the City all on the occasion of the
purchase of the marriage licence, she had given her age, he remembered
now, as twentysix. It had made no impression on him at the time. ow,
however, he perceived clearly that between twentysix and thirtyfive
there was a gap of nine years and a chill sensation came upon him of
being old and stodgy. ow dull it must be for poor little Minnie to be
cooped up night after night with such an old fogy ther men took their
wives out and gave them a good time, dancing half the night with them.
All he could do was to sit at home and read Minnie dull stuff from the
ncyclopaedia. What a life for the poor child uddenly, he felt
acutely ealous of the rubberointed idney Mercer, a man whom
hitherto he had always heartily despised.

he music stopped. hey came back to the table, Minnie with a pink glow
on her face that made her younger than ever idney, the insufferable
ass, grinning and smirking and pretending to be eighteen. hey looked
like a couple of childrenenry, catching sight of himself in a
mirror, was surprised to find that his hair was not white.

alf an hour later, in the cab going home, Minnie, half asleep, was
aroused by a sudden stiffening of the arm that encircled her waist and
a sudden snort close to her ear.

It was enry Wallace Mills resolving that he would learn to dance.

eing of a literary turn of mind and also economical, enrys first
step towards his new ambition was to buy a fiftycent book entitled
he AC of Modern ancing, by ango. It would, he feltnot
without reasonbe simpler and less expensive if he should learn the
steps by the aid of this treatise than by the more customary method of
taking lessons. ut uite early in the proceedings he was faced by
complications. In the first place, it was his intention to keep what he
was doing a secret from Minnie, in order to be able to give her a
pleasant surprise on her birthday, which would be coming round in a few
weeks. In the second place, he AC of Modern ancing proved on
investigation far more complex than its title suggested.

hese two facts were the ruin of the literary method, for, while it was
possible to study the text and the plates at the bank, the home was the
only place in which he could attempt to put the instructions into
practice. You cannot move the right foot along dotted line A  and
bring the left foot round curve C  in a payingcashiers cage in a
bank, nor, if you are at all sensitive to public opinion, on the
pavement going home. And while he was trying to do it in the parlour of
the flat one night when he imagined that Minnie was in the kitchen
cooking supper, she came in unexpectedly to ask how he wanted the steak
cooked. e explained that he had had a sudden touch of cramp, but the
incident shook his nerve.

After this he decided that he must have lessons.

Complications did not cease with this resolve. Indeed, they became more
acute. It was not that there was any difficulty about finding an
instructor. he papers were full of their advertisements. e selected a
Mme Gavarni because she lived in a convenient spot. er house was in a
side street, with a station within easy reach. he real problem was
when to find time for the lessons. is life was run on such a regular
schedule that he could hardly alter so important a moment in it as the
hour of his arrival home without exciting comment. nly deceit could
provide a solution.

Min, dear, he said at breakfast.

Yes, enry

enry turned mauve. e had never lied to her before.

Im not getting enough exercise.

Why you look so well.

I get a kind of heavy feeling sometimes. I think Ill put on another
mile or so to my walk on my way home. oso Ill be back a little
later in future.

ery well, dear.

It made him feel like a particularly low type of criminal, but, by
abandoning his walk, he was now in a position to devote an hour a day
to the lessons and Mme Gavarni had said that that would be ample.

ure, ill, she had said. he was a breezy old lady with a military
moustache and an unconventional manner with her clientele. You come to
me an hour a day, and, if you havent two left feet, well make you the
pet of society in a month.

Is that so

It sure is. I never had a failure yet with a pupe, except one. And
that wasnt my fault.

ad he two left feet

adnt any feet at all. ell off of a roof after the second lesson,
and had to have em cut off him. At that, I could have learned him to
tango with wooden legs, only he got kind of discouraged. Well, see you
Monday, ill. e good.

And the kindly old soul, retrieving her chewing gum from the panel of
the door where she had placed it to facilitate conversation, dismissed
him.

And now began what, in later years, enry unhesitatingly considered the
most miserable period of his existence. here may be times when a man
who is past his first youth feels more unhappy and ridiculous than when
he is taking a course of lessons in the modern dance, but it is not
easy to think of them. hysically, his new experience caused enry
acute pain. Muscles whose existence he had never suspected came into
being forapparentlythe sole purpose of aching. Mentally he suffered
even more.

his was partly due to the peculiar method of instruction in vogue at
Mme Gavarnis, and partly to the fact that, when it came to the actual
lessons, a sudden niece was produced from a back room to give them. he
was a blonde young lady with laughing blue eyes, and enry never
clasped her trim waist without feeling a blackhearted traitor to his
absent Minnie. Conscience racked him. Add to this the sensation of
being a strange, ointless creature with abnormally large hands and
feet, and the fact that it was Mme Gavarnis custom to stand in a
corner of the room during the hour of tuition, chewing gum and making
comments, and it is not surprising that enry became wan and thin.

Mme Gavarni had the trying habit of endeavouring to stimulate enry by
freuently comparing his performance and progress with that of a
cripple whom she claimed to have taught at some previous time.

he and the niece would have spirited arguments in his presence as to
whether or not the cripple had onestepped better after his third
lesson than enry after his fifth. he niece said no. As well, perhaps,
but not better. Mme Gavarni said that the niece was forgetting the way
the cripple had slid his feet. he niece said yes, that was so, maybe
she was. enry said nothing. e merely perspired.

e made progress slowly. his could not be blamed upon his
instructress, however. he did all that one woman could to speed him
up. ometimes she would even pursue him into the street in order to
show him on the sidewalk a means of doing away with some of his
numerous errors of techniue, the elimination of which would
help to make him definitely the cripples superior. he misery of
embracing her indoors was as nothing to the misery of embracing her on
the sidewalk.

evertheless, having paid for his course of lessons in advance, and
being a determined man, he did make progress. ne day, to his surprise,
he found his feet going through the motions without any definite
exercise of willpower on his partalmost as if they were endowed with
an intelligence of their own. It was the turningpoint. It filled him
with a singular pride such as he had not felt since his first rise of
salary at the bank.

Mme Gavarni was moved to dignified praise.

ome speed, kid she observed. ome speed

enry blushed modestly. It was the accolade.

very day, as his skill at the dance became more manifest, enry found
occasion to bless the moment when he had decided to take lessons. e
shuddered sometimes at the narrowness of his escape from disaster.
very day now it became more apparent to him, as he watched Minnie,
that she was chafing at the monotony of her life. hat fatal supper had
wrecked the peace of their little home. r perhaps it had merely
precipitated the wreck. ooner or later, he told himself, she was bound
to have wearied of the dullness of her lot. At any rate, dating from
shortly after that disturbing night, a lack of ease and spontaneity
seemed to creep into their relations. A blight settled on the home.

ittle by little Minnie and he were growing almost formal towards each
other. he had lost her taste for being read to in the evenings and had
developed a habit of pleading a headache and going early to bed.
ometimes, catching her eye when she was not expecting it, he surprised
an enigmatic look in it. It was a look, however, which he was able to
read. It meant that she was bored.

It might have been expected that this state of affairs would have
distressed enry. It gave him, on the contrary, a pleasurable thrill.
It made him feel that it had been worth it, going through the torments
of learning to dance. he more bored she was now the greater her
delight when he revealed himself dramatically. If she had been
contented with the life which he could offer her as a nondancer, what
was the sense of losing weight and money in order to learn the steps
e enoyed the silent, uneasy evenings which had supplanted those
cheery ones of the first year of their marriage. he more uncomfortable
they were now, the more they would appreciate their happiness later on.
enry belonged to the large circle of human beings who consider that
there is acuter pleasure in being suddenly cured of toothache than in
never having toothache at all.

e merely chuckled inwardly, therefore, when, on the morning of her
birthday, having presented her with a purse which he knew she had long
coveted, he found himself thanked in a perfunctory and mechanical way.

Im glad you like it, he said.

Minnie looked at the purse without enthusiasm.

Its ust what I wanted, she said, listlessly.

Well, I must be going. Ill get the tickets for the theatre while Im
in town.

Minnie hesitated for a moment.

I dont believe I want to go to the theatre much tonight, enry.

onsense. We must have a party on your birthday. Well go to the
theatre and then well have supper at Geisenheimers again. I may be
working after hours at the bank today, so I guess I wont come home.
Ill meet you at that Italian place at six.

ery well. Youll miss your walk, then

Yes. It doesnt matter for once.

o. Youre still going on with your walks, then

h, yes, yes.

hree miles every day

ever miss it. It keeps me well.

Yes.

Goodbye, darling.

Goodbye.

Yes, there was a distinct chill in the atmosphere. hank goodness,
thought enry, as he walked to the station, it would be different
tomorrow morning. e had rather the feeling of a young knight who has
done perilous deeds in secret for his lady, and is about at last to
receive credit for them.

Geisenheimers was as brilliant and noisy as it had been before when
enry reached it that night, escorting a reluctant Minnie. After a
silent dinner and a theatrical performance during which neither had
exchanged more than a word between the acts, she had wished to abandon
the idea of supper and go home. ut a suad of police could not have
kept enry from Geisenheimers. is hour had come. e had thought of
this moment for weeks, and he visualized every detail of his big scene.
At first they would sit at their table in silent discomfort. hen
idney Mercer would come up, as before, to ask Minnie to dance. And
thenthenenry would rise and, abandoning all concealment, exclaim
grandly o I am going to dance with my wife tunned amazement of
Minnie, followed by wild oy. tter rout and discomfiture of that
pinhead, Mercer. And then, when they returned to their table, he
breathing easily and regularly as a trained dancer in perfect condition
should, she tottering a little with the sudden rapture of it all, they
would sit with their heads close together and start a new life. hat
was the scenario which enry had drafted.

It worked outup to a certain pointas smoothly as ever it had done
in his dreams. he only hitch which he had fearedto wit, the
nonappearance of idney Mercer, did not occur. It would spoil the
scene a little, he had felt, if idney Mercer did not present himself
to play the role of foil but he need have had no fears on this point.
idney had the gift, not uncommon in the chinless, smoothbaked type of
man, of being able to see a pretty girl come into the restaurant even
when his back was towards the door. hey had hardly seated themselves
when he was beside their table bleating greetings.

Why, enry Always here

Wifes birthday.

Many happy returns of the day, Mrs Mills. Weve ust time for one turn
before the waiter comes with your order. Come along.

he band was staggering into a fresh tune, a tune that enry knew well.
Many a time had Mme Gavarni hammered it out of an aged and unwilling
piano in order that he might dance with her blueeyed niece. e rose.

o he exclaimed grandly. I am going to dance with my wife

e had not underestimated the sensation which he had looked forward to
causing. Minnie looked at him with round eyes. idney Mercer was
obviously startled.

I thought you couldnt dance.

You never can tell, said enry, lightly. It looks easy enough.
Anyway, Ill try.

enry cried Minnie, as he clasped her.

e had supposed that she would say something like that, but hardly in
that kind of voice. here is a way of saying enry which conveys
surprised admiration and remorseful devotion but she had not said it
in that way. here had been a note of horror in her voice. enrys was
a simple mind, and the obvious solution, that Minnie thought that he
had drunk too much red wine at the Italian restaurant, did not occur to
him.

e was, indeed, at the moment too busy to analyse vocal inflections.
hey were on the floor now, and it was beginning to creep upon him like
a chill wind that the scenario which he had mapped out was subect to
unforeseen alterations.

At first all had been well. hey had been almost alone on the floor,
and he had begun moving his feet along dotted line A  with the smooth
vim which had characterized the last few of his course of lessons. And
then, as if by magic, he was in the midst of a crowda mad, igging
crowd that seemed to have no sense of direction, no ability whatever to
keep out of his way. or a moment the tuition of weeks stood by him.
hen, a shock, a stifled cry from Minnie, and the first collision had
occurred. And with that all the knowledge which he had so painfully
acuired passed from enrys mind, leaving it an agitated blank. his
was a situation for which his slidings round an empty room had not
prepared him. tagefright at its worst came upon him. omebody charged
him in the back and asked uerulously where he thought he was going. As
he turned with a halfformed notion of apologizing, somebody else
rammed him from the other side. e had a momentary feeling as if he
were going down the iagara apids in a barrel, and then he was lying
on the floor with Minnie on top of him. omebody tripped over his head.

e sat up. omebody helped him to his feet. e was aware of idney
Mercer at his side.

o it again, said idney, all grin and sleek immaculateness. It went
down big, but lots of them didnt see it.

he place was full of demon laughter.

                               

Min said enry.

hey were in the parlour of their little flat. er back was towards
him, and he could not see her face. he did not answer. he preserved
the silence which she had maintained since they had left the
restaurant. ot once during the ourney home had she spoken.

he clock on the mantelpiece ticked on. utside an levated train
rumbled by. oices came from the street.

Min, Im sorry.

ilence.

I thought I could do it. h, ord Misery was in every note of
enrys voice. Ive been taking lessons every day since that night we
went to that place first. Its no goodI guess its like the old woman
said. Ive got two left feet, and its no use my ever trying to do it.
I kept it secret from you, what I was doing. I wanted it to be a
wonderful surprise for you on your birthday. I knew how sick and tired
you were getting of being married to a man who never took you out,
because he couldnt dance. I thought it was up to me to learn, and give
you a good time, like other mens wives. I

enry

he had turned, and with a dull amazement he saw that her whole face
had altered. er eyes were shining with a radiant happiness.

enry Was that why you went to that houseto take dancing
lessons

e stared at her without speaking. he came to him, laughing.

o that was why you pretended you were still doing your walks

You knew

I saw you come out of that house. I was ust going to the station at
the end of the street, and I saw you. here was a girl with you, a girl
with yellow hair. You hugged her

enry licked his dry lips.

Min, he said huskily. You wont believe it, but she was trying to
teach me the elly oll.

he held him by the lapels of his coat.

f course I believe it. I understand it all now. I thought at the time
that you were ust saying goodbye to her h, enry, why ever didnt
you tell me what you were doing h, yes, I know you wanted it to be a
surprise for me on my birthday, but you must have seen there was
something wrong. You must have seen that I thought something. urely
you noticed how Ive been these last weeks

I thought it was ust that you were finding it dull.

ull ere, with you

It was after you danced that night with idney Mercer. I thought the
whole thing out. Youre so much younger than I, Min. It didnt seem
right for you to have to spend your life being read to by a fellow like
me.

ut I loved it

You had to dance. very girl has to. Women cant do without it.

his one can. enry, listen You remember how ill and worn out I was
when you met me first at that farm o you know why it was It was
because I had been slaving away for years at one of those places where
you go in and pay five cents to dance with the lady instructresses. I
was a lady instructress. enry ust think what I went through very
day having to drag a million heavy men with large feet round a big
room. I tell you, you are a professional compared with some of them
hey trod on my feet and leaned their two hundred pounds on me and
nearly killed me. ow perhaps you can understand why Im not crazy
about dancing elieve me, enry, the kindest thing you can do to me is
to tell me I must never dance again.

Youyou he gulped. o you really mean that you cancan stand the
sort of life were living here You really dont find it dull

ull

he ran to the bookshelf, and came back with a large volume.

ead to me, enry, dear. ead me something now. It seems ages and ages
since you used to. ead me something out of the ncyclopaedia

enry was looking at the book in his hand. In the midst of a oy that
almost overwhelmed him, his orderly mind was conscious of something
wrong.

ut this is the MMM volume, darling.

Is it Well, thatll be all right. ead me all about Mum.

ut were only in the CACA e wavered. h, wellI he went on,
recklessly. I dont care. o you

o. it down here, dear, and Ill sit on the floor.

enry cleared his throat.

Milicz, or Militsch d. , ohemian divine, was the most
influential among those preachers and writers in Moravia and ohemia
who, during the fourteenth century, in a certain sense paved the way
for the reforming activity of uss.

e looked down. Minnies soft hair was resting against his knee. e put
out a hand and stroked it. he turned and looked up, and he met her big
eyes.

Can you beat it said enry, silently, to himself.
