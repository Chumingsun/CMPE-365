               A ourney into the nterior of the Earth

                            by ules erne



edactor's ote: The following version of ules erne's ourney
into the nterior of the Earth was published by Ward, ock, Co.,
td., ondon, in . This version is believed to be the most
faithful rendition into English of this classic currently in the
public domain. The few notes of the translator are located near the
point where they are referenced. The unic characters in Chapter 
are visible in the TM version of the tet. The character set is
S, mainly the Windows character set. The translation is by
Frederick Amadeus Malleson.

While the translation is fairly literal, and Malleson a clergyman
has taken pains with the scientific portions of the work and added
the chapter headings, he has made some unfortunate emendations mainly
concerning biblical references, and has added a few 'improvements' of
his own, which are detailed below:

. pertubata seu inordinata, as Euclid has it.

. cry, Thalatta thalatta the sea the sea The deeply indented
shore was lined with a breadth of fine shining sand, softly

. hippopotamus. as if the creator, pressed for time in the
first hours of the world, had assembled several animals into one.
The colossal mastodon

.  return to the scriptural periods or ages of the world,
conventionally called 'days,' long before the appearance of man when
the unfinished world was as yet unfitted for his support.  return
to the biblical epochs of the creation, well in advance of the birth
of man, when the incomplete earth was not yet sufficient for him.

. footnote, and which is illustrated in the negro
countenance and in the lowest savages.

. of the geologic period. antediluvian

These corrections have kindly been pointed out by Christian Snche
chvsanchearnet.com.ar of the ules erne Forum.

EFACE


TE oyages Etraordinaires of M. ules erne deserve to be made
widely known in Englishspeaking countries by means of carefully
prepared translations. Witty and ingenious adaptations of the
researches and discoveries of modern science to the popular taste,
which demands that these should be presented to ordinary readers in
the lighter form of cleverly mingled truth and fiction, these books
will assuredly be read with profit and delight, especially by English
youth. Certainly no writer before M. ules erne has been so happy in
weaving together in udicious combination severe scientific truth
with a charming eercise of playful imagination.

celand, the starting point of the marvellous underground ourney
imagined in this volume, is invested at the present time with a
painful interest in conseuence of the disastrous eruptions last
Easter ay, which covered with lava and ashes the poor and scanty
vegetation upon which four thousand persons were partly dependent for
the means of subsistence. For a long time to come the natives of that
interesting island, who cleave to their desert home with all that
amor patriae which is so much more easily understood than
eplained, will look, and look not in vain, for the help of those on
whom fall the smiles of a kindlier sun in regions not torn by
earthuakes nor blasted and ravaged by volcanic fires. Will the
readers of this little book, who, are gifted with the means of
indulging in the luury of etended beneficence, remember the
distress of their brethren in the far north, whom distance has not
barred from the claim of being counted our neighbours? And whatever
their humane feelings may prompt them to bestow will be gladly added
to the Mansionouse celand elief Fund.

n his desire to ascertain how far the picture of celand, drawn in
the work of ules erne is a correct one, the translator hopes in the
course of a mail or two to receive a communication from a leading man
of science in the island, which may furnish matter for additional
information in a future edition.

The scientific portion of the French original is not without a few
errors, which the translator, with the kind assistance of Mr. Cameron
of . M. Geological Survey, has ventured to point out and correct. t
is scarcely to be epected in a work in which the element of
amusement is intended to enter more largely than that of scientific
instruction, that any great degree of accuracy should be arrived at.
et the translator hopes that what trifling deviations from the tet
or corrections in foot notes he is responsible for, will have done a
little towards the increased usefulness of the work.

TE FESS A S FAM


n the th of May, , my uncle, rofessor iedenbrock, rushed
into his little house, o.  nigstrasse, one of the oldest streets
in the oldest portion of the city of amburg.

Martha must have concluded that she was very much behindhand, for the
dinner had only ust been put into the oven.

Well, now, said  to myself, if that most impatient of men is
hungry, what a disturbance he will make

M. iedenbrock so soon cried poor Martha in great alarm, half
opening the diningroom door.

es, Martha but very likely the dinner is not half cooked, for it
is not two yet. Saint Michael's clock has only ust struck halfpast
one.

Then why has the master come home so soon?

erhaps he will tell us that himself.

ere he is, Monsieur Ael  will run and hide myself while you
argue with him.

And Martha retreated in safety into her own dominions.

 was left alone. ut how was it possible for a man of my undecided
turn of mind to argue successfully with so irascible a person as the
rofessor? With this persuasion  was hurrying away to my own little
retreat upstairs, when the street door creaked upon its hinges heavy
feet made the whole flight of stairs to shake and the master of the
house, passing rapidly through the diningroom, threw himself in
haste into his own sanctum.

ut on his rapid way he had found time to fling his hael stick into
a corner, his rough broadbrim upon the table, and these few emphatic
words at his nephew:

Ael, follow me

 had scarcely had time to move when the rofessor was again shouting
after me:

What not come yet?

And  rushed into my redoubtable master's study.

tto iedenbrock had no mischief in him,  willingly allow that but
unless he very considerably changes as he grows older, at the end he
will be a most original character.

e was professor at the ohannum, and was delivering a series of
lectures on mineralogy, in the course of every one of which he broke
into a passion once or twice at least. ot at all that he was
overanious about the improvement of his class, or about the degree
of attention with which they listened to him, or the success which
might eventually crown his labours. Such little matters of detail
never troubled him much. is teaching was as the German philosophy
calls it, 'subective' it was to benefit himself, not others. e was
a learned egotist. e was a well of science, and the pulleys worked
uneasily when you wanted to draw anything out of it. n a word, he
was a learned miser.

Germany has not a few professors of this sort.

To his misfortune, my uncle was not gifted with a sufficiently rapid
utterance not, to be sure, when he was talking at home, but
certainly in his public delivery this is a want much to be deplored
in a speaker. The fact is, that during the course of his lectures at
the ohannum, the rofessor often came to a complete standstill he
fought with wilful words that refused to pass his struggling lips,
such words as resist and distend the cheeks, and at last break out
into the unaskedfor shape of a round and most unscientific oath:
then his fury would gradually abate.

ow in mineralogy there are many halfGreek and halfatin terms,
very hard to articulate, and which would be most trying to a poet's
measures.  don't wish to say a word against so respectable a
science, far be that from me. True, in the august presence of
rhombohedral crystals, retinasphaltic resins, gehlenites, Fassaites,
molybdenites, tungstates of manganese, and titanite of irconium,
why, the most facile of tongues may make a slip now and then.

t therefore happened that this venial fault of my uncle's came to be
pretty well understood in time, and an unfair advantage was taken of
it the students laid wait for him in dangerous places, and when he
began to stumble, loud was the laughter, which is not in good taste,
not even in Germans. And if there was always a full audience to
honour the iedenbrock courses,  should be sorry to conecture how
many came to make merry at my uncle's epense.

evertheless my good uncle was a man of deep learninga fact  am
most anious to assert and reassert. Sometimes he might irretrievably
inure a specimen by his too great ardour in handling it but still
he united the genius of a true geologist with the keen eye of the
mineralogist. Armed with his hammer, his steel pointer, his magnetic
needles, his blowpipe, and his bottle of nitric acid, he was a
powerful man of science. e would refer any mineral to its proper
place among the si hundred  elementary substances now enumerated,
by its fracture, its appearance, its hardness, its fusibility, its
sonorousness, its smell, and its taste.

The name of iedenbrock was honourably mentioned in colleges and
learned societies. umphry avy,  umboldt, Captain Sir ohn
Franklin, General Sabine, never failed to call upon him on their way
through amburg. ecuerel, Ebelman, rewster, umas, MilneEdwards,
SaintClaireeville freuently consulted him upon the most difficult
problems in chemistry, a science which was indebted to him for
considerable discoveries, for in  there had appeared at eipig
an imposing folio by tto iedenbrock, entitled, A Treatise upon
Transcendental Chemistry, with plates a work, however, which failed
to cover its epenses.

To all these titles to honour let me add that my uncle was the
curator of the museum of mineralogy formed by M. Struve, the ussian
ambassador a most valuable collection, the fame of which is European.

Such was the gentleman who addressed me in that impetuous manner.
Fancy a tall, spare man, of an iron constitution, and with a fair
compleion which took off a good ten years from the fifty he must own
to. is restless eyes were in incessant motion behind his fullsied
spectacles. is long, thin nose was like a knife blade. oys have
been heard to remark that that organ was magnetised and attracted
iron filings. ut this was merely a mischievous report it had no
attraction ecept for snuff, which it seemed to draw to itself in
great uantities.

When  have added, to complete my portrait, that my uncle walked by
mathematical strides of a yard and a half, and that in walking he
kept his fists firmly closed, a sure sign of an irritable
temperament,  think  shall have said enough to disenchant any one
who should by mistake have coveted much of his company.

e lived in his own little house in nigstrasse, a structure half
brick and half wood, with a gable cut into steps it looked upon one
of those winding canals which intersect each other in the middle of
the ancient uarter of amburg, and which the great fire of  had
fortunately spared.

 Sitythree. Tr.

 As Sir umphry avy died in , the translator must be pardoned
for pointing out here an anachronism, unless we are to assume that
the learned rofessor's celebrity dawned in his earliest years. Tr.

t is true that the old house stood slightly off the perpendicular,
and bulged out a little towards the street its roof sloped a little
to one side, like the cap over the left ear of a Tugendbund student
its lines wanted accuracy but after all, it stood firm, thanks to an
old elm which buttressed it in front, and which often in spring sent
its young sprays through the window panes.

My uncle was tolerably well off for a German professor. The house was
his own, and everything in it. The living contents were his
goddaughter Gruben, a young irlandaise of seventeen, Martha, and
myself. As his nephew and an orphan,  became his laboratory
assistant.

 freely confess that  was eceedingly fond of geology and all its
kindred sciences the blood of a mineralogist was in my veins, and in
the midst of my specimens  was always happy.

n a word, a man might live happily enough in the little old house in
the nigstrasse, in spite of the restless impatience of its master,
for although he was a little too ecitablehe was very fond of me.
ut the man had no notion how to wait nature herself was too slow
for him. n April, after he had planted in the terracotta pots
outside his window seedling plants of mignonette and convolvulus, he
would go and give them a little pull by their leaves to make them
grow faster. n dealing with such a strange individual there was
nothing for it but prompt obedience.  therefore rushed after him.

That study of his was a museum, and nothing else. Specimens of
everything known in mineralogy lay there in their places in perfect
order, and correctly named, divided into inflammable, metallic, and
lithoid minerals.

ow well  knew all these bits of science Many a time, instead of
enoying the company of lads of my own age,  had preferred dusting
these graphites, anthracites, coals, lignites, and peats And there
were bitumens, resins, organic salts, to be protected from the least
grain of dust and metals, from iron to gold, metals whose current
value altogether disappeared in the presence of the republican
euality of scientific specimens and stones too, enough to rebuild
entirely the house in nigstrasse, even with a handsome additional
room, which would have suited me admirably.

ut on entering this study now  thought of none of all these
wonders my uncle alone filled my thoughts. e had thrown himself
into a velvet easychair, and was grasping between his hands a book
over which he bent, pondering with intense admiration.

ere's a remarkable book What a wonderful book he was eclaiming.

These eaculations brought to my mind the fact that my uncle was
liable to occasional fits of bibliomania but no old book had any
value in his eyes unless it had the virtue of being nowhere else to
be found, or, at any rate, of being illegible.

Well, now don't you see it yet? Why  have got a priceless
treasure, that  found his morning, in rummaging in old evelius's
shop, the ew.

Magnificent  replied, with a good imitation of enthusiasm.

What was the good of all this fuss about an old uarto, bound in
rough calf, a yellow, faded volume, with a ragged seal depending from
it?

ut for all that there was no lull yet in the admiring eclamations
of the rofessor.

See, he went on, both asking the uestions and supplying the
answers. sn't it a beauty? es splendid id you ever see such a
binding? oesn't the book open easily? es it stops open anywhere.
ut does it shut eually well? es for the binding and the leaves
are flush, all in a straight line, and no gaps or openings anywhere.
And look at its back, after seven hundred years. Why, oerian,
Closs, or urgold might have been proud of such a binding

While rapidly making these comments my uncle kept opening and
shutting the old tome.  really could do no less than ask a uestion
about its contents, although  did not feel the slightest interest.

And what is the title of this marvellous work?  asked with an
affected eagerness which he must have been very blind not to see
through.

This work, replied my uncle, firing up with renewed enthusiasm,
this work is the eims ringla of Snorre Turlleson, the most famous
celandic author of the twelfth century t is the chronicle of the
orwegian princes who ruled in celand.

ndeed  cried, keeping up wonderfully, of course it is a German
translation?

What sharply replied the rofessor, a translation What should 
do with a translation? This is the celandic original, in the
magnificent idiomatic vernacular, which is both rich and simple, and
admits of an infinite variety of grammatical combinations and verbal
modifications.

ike German.  happily ventured.

es, replied my uncle, shrugging his shoulders but, in addition
to all this, the celandic has three numbers like the Greek, and
irregular declensions of nouns proper like the atin.

Ah said , a little moved out of my indifference and is the type
good?

Type What do you mean by talking of type, wretched Ael? Type o
you take it for a printed book, you ignorant fool? t is a
manuscript, a unic manuscript.

unic?

es. o you want me to eplain what that is?

f course not,  replied in the tone of an inured man. ut my
uncle persevered, and told me, against my will, of many things 
cared nothing about.

unic characters were in use in celand in former ages. They were
invented, it is said, by din himself. ook there, and wonder,
impious young man, and admire these letters, the invention of the
Scandinavian god

Well, well not knowing what to say,  was going to prostrate myself
before this wonderful book, a way of answering eually pleasing to
gods and kings, and which has the advantage of never giving them any
embarrassment, when a little incident happened to divert conversation
into another channel.

This was the appearance of a dirty slip of parchment, which slipped
out of the volume and fell upon the floor.

My uncle pounced upon this shred with incredible avidity. An old
document, enclosed an immemorial time within the folds of this old
book, had for him an immeasurable value.

What's this? he cried.

And he laid out upon the table a piece of parchment, five inches by
three, and along which were traced certain mysterious characters.

ere is the eact facsimile.  think it important to let these
strange signs be publicly known, for they were the means of drawing
on rofessor iedenbrock and his nephew to undertake the most
wonderful epedition of the nineteenth century.

unic glyphs occur here

The rofessor mused a few moments over this series of characters
then raising his spectacles he pronounced:

These are unic letters they are eactly like those of the
manuscript of Snorre Turlleson. ut, what on earth is their meaning?

unic letters appearing to my mind to be an invention of the learned
to mystify this poor world,  was not sorry to see my uncle suffering
the pangs of mystification. At least, so it seemed to me, udging
from his fingers, which were beginning to work with terrible energy.

t is certainly old celandic, he muttered between his teeth.

And rofessor iedenbrock must have known, for he was acknowledged to
be uite a polyglot. ot that he could speak fluently in the two
thousand languages and twelve thousand dialects which are spoken on
the earth, but he knew at least his share of them.

So he was going, in the presence of this difficulty, to give way to
all the impetuosity of his character, and  was preparing for a
violent outbreak, when two o'clock struck by the little timepiece
over the fireplace.

At that moment our good housekeeper Martha opened the study door,
saying:

inner is ready

 am afraid he sent that soup to where it would boil away to nothing,
and Martha took to her heels for safety.  followed her, and hardly
knowing how  got there  found myself seated in my usual place.

 waited a few minutes. o rofessor came. ever within my
remembrance had he missed the important ceremonial of dinner. And yet
what a good dinner it was There was parsley soup, an omelette of ham
garnished with spiced sorrel, a fillet of veal with compote of
prunes for dessert, crystallised fruit the whole washed down with
sweet Moselle.

All this my uncle was going to sacrifice to a bit of old parchment.
As an affectionate and attentive nephew  considered it my duty to
eat for him as well as for myself, which  did conscientiously.

 have never known such a thing, said Martha. M. iedenbrock is
not at table

Who could have believed it?  said, with my mouth full.

Something serious is going to happen, said the servant, shaking her
head.

My opinion was, that nothing more serious would happen than an awful
scene when my uncle should have discovered that his dinner was
devoured.  had come to the last of the fruit when a very loud voice
tore me away from the pleasures of my dessert. With one spring 
bounded out of the diningroom into the study.

ndoubtedly it is unic, said the rofessor, bending his brows
but there is a secret in it, and  mean to discover the key.

A violent gesture finished the sentence.

Sit there, he added, holding out his fist towards the table. Sit
there, and write.

 was seated in a trice.

ow  will dictate to you every letter of our alphabet which
corresponds with each of these celandic characters. We will see what
that will give us. ut, by St. Michael, if you should dare to deceive
me

The dictation commenced.  did my best. Every letter was given me one
after the other, with the following remarkable result:

edactor: n the original version the initial letter is an 'm' with
a superscore over it. t is my supposition that this is the
translator's way of writing 'mm' and  have replaced it accordingly,
since our typography does not allow such a character.

When this work was ended my uncle tore the paper from me and eamined
it attentively for a long time.

What does it all mean? he kept repeating mechanically.

pon my honour  could not have enlightened him. esides he did not
ask me, and he went on talking to himself.

This is what is called a cryptogram, or cipher, he said, in which
letters are purposely thrown in confusion, which if properly arranged
would reveal their sense. nly think that under this argon there may
lie concealed the clue to some great discovery

As for me,  was of opinion that there was nothing at all, in it
though, of course,  took care not to say so.

Then the rofessor took the book and the parchment, and diligently
compared them together.

These two writings are not by the same hand, he said the cipher
is of later date than the book, an undoubted proof of which  see in
a moment. The first letter is a double m, a letter which is not to be
found in Turlleson's book, and which was only added to the alphabet
in the fourteenth century. Therefore there are two hundred years
between the manuscript and the document.

 admitted that this was a strictly logical conclusion.

 am therefore led to imagine, continued my uncle, that some
possessor of this book wrote these mysterious letters. ut who was
that possessor? s his name nowhere to be found in the manuscript?

My uncle raised his spectacles, took up a strong lens, and carefully
eamined the blank pages of the book. n the front of the second, the
titlepage, he noticed a sort of stain which looked like an ink blot.
ut in looking at it very closely he thought he could distinguish
some halfeffaced letters. My uncle at once fastened upon this as the
centre of interest, and he laboured at that blot, until by the help
of his microscope he ended by making out the following unic
characters which he read without difficulty.

Arne Saknussemm he cried in triumph. Why that is the name of
another celander, a savant of the siteenth century, a celebrated
alchemist

 gaed at my uncle with satisfactory admiration.

Those alchemists, he resumed, Avicenna, acon, ully, aracelsus,
were the real and only savants of their time. They made discoveries
at which we are astonished. as not this Saknussemm concealed under
his cryptogram some surprising invention? t is so it must be so

The rofessor's imagination took fire at this hypothesis.

o doubt,  ventured to reply, but what interest would he have in
thus hiding so marvellous a discovery?

Why? Why? ow can  tell? id not Galileo do the same by Saturn? We
shall see.  will get at the secret of this document, and  will
neither sleep nor eat until  have found it out.

My comment on this was a halfsuppressed h

or you either, Ael, he added.

The deuce said  to myself then it is lucky  have eaten two
dinners today

First of all we must find out the key to this cipher that cannot be
difficult.

At these words  uickly raised my head but my uncle went on
solilouising.

There's nothing easier. n this document there are a hundred and
thirtytwo letters, vi., seventyseven consonants and fiftyfive
vowels. This is the proportion found in southern languages, whilst
northern tongues are much richer in consonants therefore this is in
a southern language.

These were very fair conclusions,  thought.

ut what language is it?

ere  looked for a display of learning, but  met instead with
profound analysis.

This Saknussemm, he went on, was a very wellinformed man now
since he was not writing in his own mother tongue, he would naturally
select that which was currently adopted by the choice spirits of the
siteenth century  mean atin. f  am mistaken,  can but try
Spanish, French, talian, Greek, or ebrew. ut the savants of the
siteenth century generally wrote in atin.  am therefore entitled
to pronounce this,  priori, to be atin. t is atin.

 umped up in my chair. My atin memories rose in revolt against the
notion that these barbarous words could belong to the sweet language
of irgil.

es, it is atin, my uncle went on but it is atin confused and
in disorder pertubata seu inordinata, as Euclid has it.

ery well, thought , if you can bring order out of that
confusion, my dear uncle, you are a clever man.

et us eamine carefully, said he again, taking up the leaf upon
which  had written. ere is a series of one hundred and thirtytwo
letters in apparent disorder. There are words consisting of
consonants only, as nrrlls others, on the other hand, in which
vowels predominate, as for instance the fifth, uneeief, or the last
but one, oseibo. ow this arrangement has evidently not been
premeditated it has arisen mathematically in obedience to the
unknown law which has ruled in the succession of these letters. t
appears to me a certainty that the original sentence was written in a
proper manner, and afterwards distorted by a law which we have yet to
discover. Whoever possesses the key of this cipher will read it with
fluency. What is that key? Ael, have you got it?

 answered not a word, and for a very good reason. My eyes had fallen
upon a charming picture, suspended against the wall, the portrait of
Gruben. My uncle's ward was at that time at Altona, staying with a
relation, and in her absence  was very downhearted for  may
confess it to you now, the pretty irlandaise and the professor's
nephew loved each other with a patience and a calmness entirely
German. We had become engaged unknown to my uncle, who was too much
taken up with geology to be able to enter into such feelings as ours.
Gruben was a lovely blueeyed blonde, rather given to gravity and
seriousness but that did not prevent her from loving me very
sincerely. As for me,  adored her, if there is such a word in the
German language. Thus it happened that the picture of my pretty
irlandaise threw me in a moment out of the world of realities into
that of memory and fancy.

There looked down upon me the faithful companion of my labours and my
recreations. Every day she helped me to arrange my uncle's precious
specimens she and  labelled them together. Mademoiselle Gruben was
an accomplished mineralogist she could have taught a few things to a
savant. She was fond of investigating abstruse scientific uestions.
What pleasant hours we have spent in study and how often  envied
the very stones which she handled with her charming fingers.

Then, when our leisure hours came, we used to go out together and
turn into the shady avenues by the Alster, and went happily side by
side up to the old windmill, which forms such an improvement to the
landscape at the head of the lake. n the road we chatted hand in
hand  told her amusing tales at which she laughed heartily. Then we
reached the banks of the Elbe, and after having bid goodbye to the
swan, sailing gracefully amidst the white water lilies, we returned
to the uay by the steamer.

That is ust where  was in my dream, when my uncle with a vehement
thump on the table dragged me back to the realities of life.

Come, said he, the very first idea which would come into any one's
head to confuse the letters of a sentence would be to write the words
vertically instead of horiontally.

ndeed said .

ow we must see what would be the effect of that, Ael put down
upon this paper any sentence you like, only instead of arranging the
letters in the usual way, one after the other, place them in
succession in vertical columns, so as to group them together in five
or si vertical lines.

 caught his meaning, and immediately produced the following literary
wonder:

     e       e       y       e       a       

Good, said the professor, without reading them, now set down those
words in a horiontal line.

 obeyed, and with this result:

Ecellent said my uncle, taking the paper hastily out of my hands.
This begins to look ust like an ancient document: the vowels and
the consonants are grouped together in eual disorder there are even
capitals in the middle of words, and commas too, ust as in
Saknussemm's parchment.

 considered these remarks very clever.

ow, said my uncle, looking straight at me, to read the sentence
which you have ust written, and with which  am wholly unacuainted,
 shall only have to take the first letter of each word, then the
second, the third, and so forth.

And my uncle, to his great astonishment, and my much greater, read:

      love you well, my own dear Gruben

allo cried the rofessor.

es, indeed, without knowing what  was about, like an awkward and
unlucky lover,  had compromised myself by writing this unfortunate
sentence.

Aha you are in love with Gruben? he said, with the right look for
a guardian.

es no  stammered.

ou love Gruben, he went on once or twice dreamily. Well, let us
apply the process  have suggested to the document in uestion.

My uncle, falling back into his absorbing contemplations, had already
forgotten my imprudent words.  merely say imprudent, for the great
mind of so learned a man of course had no place for love affairs, and
happily the grand business of the document gained me the victory.

ust as the moment of the supreme eperiment arrived the rofessor's
eyes flashed right through his spectacles. There was a uivering in
his fingers as he grasped the old parchment. e was deeply moved. At
last he gave a preliminary cough, and with profound gravity, naming
in succession the first, then the second letter of each word, he
dictated me the following:

     mmessvnkaSenrA.icefdo.segnittamvrtn
     ecertserrette,rotaisadva,ednecsedsadne
     lacartniiilvsiratracSarbmvtabiledmek

 confess  felt considerably ecited in coming to the end these
letters named, one at a time, had carried no sense to my mind 
therefore waited for the rofessor with great pomp to unfold the
magnificent but hidden atin of this mysterious phrase.

ut who could have foretold the result? A violent thump made the
furniture rattle, and spilt some ink, and my pen dropped from between
my fingers.

That's not it, cried my uncle, there's no sense in it.

Then darting out like a shot, bowling down stairs like an avalanche,
he rushed into the nigstrasse and fled.

e is gone cried Martha, running out of her kitchen at the noise
of the violent slamming of doors.

es,  replied, completely gone.

Well and how about his dinner? said the old servant.

e won't have any.

And his supper?

e won't have any.

What? cried Martha, with clasped hands.

o, my dear Martha, he will eat no more. o one in the house is to
eat anything at all. ncle iedenbrock is going to make us all fast
until he has succeeded in deciphering an undecipherable scrawl.

h, my dear must we then all die of hunger?

 hardly dared to confess that, with so absolute a ruler as my uncle,
this fate was inevitable.

The old servant, visibly moved, returned to the kitchen, moaning
piteously.

When  was alone,  thought  would go and tell Gruben all about it.
ut how should  be able to escape from the house? The rofessor
might return at any moment. And suppose he called me? And suppose he
tackled me again with this logomachy, which might vainly have been
set before ancient edipus. And if  did not obey his call, who could
answer for what might happen?

The wisest course was to remain where  was. A mineralogist at
esanon had ust sent us a collection of siliceous nodules, which 
had to classify: so  set to work  sorted, labelled, and arranged
in their own glass case all these hollow specimens, in the cavity of
each of which was a nest of little crystals.

ut this work did not succeed in absorbing all my attention. That old
document kept working in my brain. My head throbbed with ecitement,
and  felt an undefined uneasiness.  was possessed with a
presentiment of coming evil.

n an hour my nodules were all arranged upon successive shelves. Then
 dropped down into the old velvet armchair, my head thrown back and
my hands oined over it.  lighted my long crooked pipe, with a
painting on it of an idlelooking naiad then  amused myself
watching the process of the conversion of the tobacco into carbon,
which was by slow degrees making my naiad into a negress. ow and
then  listened to hear whether a wellknown step was on the stairs.
o. Where could my uncle be at that moment?  fancied him running
under the noble trees which line the road to Altona, gesticulating,
making shots with his cane, thrashing the long grass, cutting the
heads off the thistles, and disturbing the contemplative storks in
their peaceful solitude.

Would he return in triumph or in discouragement? Which would get the
upper hand, he or the secret?  was thus asking myself uestions, and
mechanically taking between my fingers the sheet of paper
mysteriously disfigured with the incomprehensible succession of
letters  had written down and  repeated to myself What does it
all mean?

 sought to group the letters so as to form words. uite impossible
When  put them together by twos, threes, fives or sies, nothing
came of it but nonsense. To be sure the fourteenth, fifteenth and
siteenth letters made the English word 'ice' the eightythird and
two following made 'sir' and in the midst of the document, in the
second and third lines,  observed the words, rots, mutabile,
ira, net, atra.

Come now,  thought, these words seem to ustify my uncle's view
about the language of the document. n the fourth line appeared the
word luco, which means a sacred wood. t is true that in the third
line was the word tabiled, which looked like ebrew, and in the
last the purely French words mer, arc, mere.

All this was enough to drive a poor fellow cray. Four different
languages in this ridiculous sentence What connection could there
possibly be between such words as ice, sir, anger, cruel, sacred
wood, changeable, mother, bow, and sea? The first and the last might
have something to do with each other it was not at all surprising
that in a document written in celand there should be mention of a
sea of ice but it was uite another thing to get to the end of this
cryptogram with so small a clue. So  was struggling with an
insurmountable difficulty my brain got heated, my eyes watered over
that sheet of paper its hundred and thirtytwo letters seemed to
flutter and fly around me like those motes of mingled light and
darkness which float in the air around the head when the blood is
rushing upwards with undue violence.  was a prey to a kind of
hallucination  was stifling  wanted air. nconsciously  fanned
myself with the bit of paper, the back and front of which
successively came before my eyes. What was my surprise when, in one
of those rapid revolutions, at the moment when the back was turned to
me  thought  caught sight of the atin words craterem,
terrestre, and others.

A sudden light burst in upon me these hints alone gave me the first
glimpse of the truth  had discovered the key to the cipher. To read
the document, it would not even be necessary to read it through the
paper. Such as it was, ust such as it had been dictated to me, so it
might be spelt out with ease. All those ingenious professorial
combinations were coming right. e was right as to the arrangement of
the letters he was right as to the language. e had been within a
hair's breadth of reading this atin document from end to end but
that hair's breadth, chance had given it to me

ou may be sure  felt stirred up. My eyes were dim,  could scarcely
see.  had laid the paper upon the table. At a glance  could tell
the whole secret.

At last  became more calm.  made a wise resolve to walk twice round
the room uietly and settle my nerves, and then  returned into the
deep gulf of the huge armchair.

ow 'll read it,  cried, after having well distended my lungs
with air.

 leaned over the table  laid my finger successively upon every
letter and without a pause, without one moment's hesitation,  read
off the whole sentence aloud.

Stupefaction terror  sat overwhelmed as if with a sudden deadly
blow. What that which  read had actually, really been done A
mortal man had had the audacity to penetrate . . .

Ah  cried, springing up. ut no no My uncle shall never know
it. e would insist upon doing it too. e would want to know all
about it. opes could not hold him, such a determined geologist as he
is e would start, he would, in spite of everything and everybody,
and he would take me with him, and we should never get back. o,

My overecitement was beyond all description.

o no it shall not be,  declared energetically and as it is in
my power to prevent the knowledge of it coming into the mind of my
tyrant,  will do it. y dint of turning this document round and
round, he too might discover the key.  will destroy it.

There was a little fire left on the hearth.  seied not only the
paper but Saknussemm's parchment with a feverish hand  was about to
fling it all upon the coals and utterly destroy and abolish this
dangerous secret, when the study door opened, and my uncle appeared.

 had only ust time to replace the unfortunate document upon the
table.

rofessor iedenbrock seemed to be greatly abstracted.

The ruling thought gave him no rest. Evidently he had gone deeply
into the matter, analytically and with profound scrutiny. e had
brought all the resources of his mind to bear upon it during his
walk, and he had come back to apply some new combination.

e sat in his armchair, and pen in hand he began what looked very
much like algebraic formula:  followed with my eyes his trembling
hands,  took count of every movement. Might not some unhopedfor
result come of it?  trembled, too, very unnecessarily, since the
true key was in my hands, and no other would open the secret.

For three long hours my uncle worked on without a word, without
lifting his head rubbing out, beginning again, then rubbing out
again, and so on a hundred times.

 knew very well that if he succeeded in setting down these letters
in every possible relative position, the sentence would come out. ut
 knew also that twenty letters alone could form two uintillions,
four hundred and thirtytwo uadrillions, nine hundred and two
trillions, eight billions, a hundred and seventysi millions, si
hundred and forty thousand combinations. ow, here were a hundred and
thirtytwo letters in this sentence, and these hundred and thirtytwo
letters would give a number of different sentences, each made up of
at least a hundred and thirtythree figures, a number which passed
far beyond all calculation or conception.

So  felt reassured as far as regarded this heroic method of solving
the difficulty.

ut time was passing away night came on the street noises ceased
my uncle, bending over his task, noticed nothing, not even Martha
half opening the door he heard not a sound, not even that ecellent
woman saying:

Will not monsieur take any supper tonight?

And poor Martha had to go away unanswered. As for me, after long
resistance,  was overcome by sleep, and fell off at the end of the
sofa, while uncle iedenbrock went on calculating and rubbing out his
calculations.

When  awoke net morning that indefatigable worker was still at his
post. is red eyes, his pale compleion, his hair tangled between his
feverish fingers, the red spots on his cheeks, revealed his desperate
struggle with impossibilities, and the weariness of spirit, the
mental wrestlings he must have undergone all through that unhappy
night.

To tell the plain truth,  pitied him. n spite of the reproaches
which  considered  had a right to lay upon him, a certain feeling
of compassion was beginning to gain upon me. The poor man was so
entirely taken up with his one idea that he had even forgotten how to
get angry. All the strength of his feelings was concentrated upon one
point alone and as their usual vent was closed, it was to be feared
lest etreme tension should give rise to an eplosion sooner or later.

 might with a word have loosened the screw of the steel vice that
was crushing his brain but that word  would not speak.

et  was not an illnatured fellow. Why was  dumb at such a crisis?
Why so insensible to my uncle's interests?

o, no,  repeated,  shall not speak. e would insist upon going
nothing on earth could stop him. is imagination is a volcano, and to
do that which other geologists have never done he would risk his
life.  will preserve silence.  will keep the secret which mere
chance has revealed to me. To discover it, would be to kill rofessor
iedenbrock et him find it out himself if he can.  will never have
it laid to my door that  led him to his destruction.

aving formed this resolution,  folded my arms and waited. ut  had
not reckoned upon one little incident which turned up a few hours
after.

When our good Martha wanted to go to Market, she found the door
locked. The big key was gone. Who could have taken it out? Assuredly,
it was my uncle, when he returned the night before from his hurried
walk.

Was this done on purpose? r was it a mistake? id he want to reduce
us by famine? This seemed like going rather too far What should
Martha and  be victims of a position of things in which we had not
the smallest interest? t was a fact that a few years before this,
whilst my uncle was working at his great classification of minerals,
he was fortyeight hours without eating, and all his household were
obliged to share in this scientific fast. As for me, what  remember
is, that  got severe cramps in my stomach, which hardly suited the
constitution of a hungry, growing lad.

ow it appeared to me as if breakfast was going to be wanting, ust
as supper had been the night before. et  resolved to be a hero, and
not to be conuered by the pangs of hunger. Martha took it very
seriously, and, poor woman, was very much distressed. As for me, the
impossibility of leaving the house distressed me a good deal more,
and for a very good reason. A caged lover's feelings may easily be
imagined.

My uncle went on working, his imagination went off rambling into the
ideal world of combinations he was far away from earth, and really
far away from earthly wants.

About noon hunger began to stimulate me severely. Martha had, without
thinking any harm, cleared out the larder the night before, so that
now there was nothing left in the house. Still  held out  made it
a point of honour.

Two o'clock struck. This was becoming ridiculous worse than that,
unbearable.  began to say to myself that  was eaggerating the
importance of the document that my uncle would surely not believe in
it, that he would set it down as a mere pule that if it came to
the worst, we should lay violent hands on him and keep him at home if
he thought on venturing on the epedition that, after all, he might
himself discover the key of the cipher, and that then  should be
clear at the mere epense of my involuntary abstinence.

These reasons seemed ecellent to me, though on the night before 
should have reected them with indignation  even went so far as to
condemn myself for my absurdity in having waited so long, and 
finally resolved to let it all out.

 was therefore meditating a proper introduction to the matter, so as
not to seem too abrupt, when the rofessor umped up, clapped on his
hat, and prepared to go out.

Surely he was not going out, to shut us in again no, never

ncle  cried.

e seemed not to hear me.

ncle iedenbrock  cried, lifting up my voice.

Ay, he answered like a man suddenly waking.

ncle, that key

What key? The door key?

o, no  cried. The key of the document.

The rofessor stared at me over his spectacles no doubt he saw
something unusual in the epression of my countenance for he laid
hold of my arm, and speechlessly uestioned me with his eyes. es,
never was a uestion more forcibly put.

 nodded my head up and down.

e shook his pityingly, as if he was dealing with a lunatic.  gave a
more affirmative gesture.

is eyes glistened and sparkled with live fire, his hand was shaken
threateningly.

This mute conversation at such a momentous crisis would have riveted
the attention of the most indifferent. And the fact really was that 
dared not speak now, so intense was the ecitement for fear lest my
uncle should smother me in his first oyful embraces. ut he became
so urgent that  was at last compelled to answer.

es, that key, chance

What is that you are saying? he shouted with indescribable emotion.

There, read that  said, presenting a sheet of paper on which 
had written.

ut there is nothing in this, he answered, crumpling up the paper.

o, nothing until you proceed to read from the end to the beginning.

 had not finished my sentence when the rofessor broke out into a
cry, nay, a roar. A new revelation burst in upon him. e was
transformed

Aha, clever Saknussemm he cried. ou had first written out your
sentence the wrong way.

And darting upon the paper, with eyes bedimmed, and voice choked with
emotion, he read the whole document from the last letter to the first.

t was conceived in the following terms:

     n Sneffels oculis craterem uem delibat
     mbra Scartaris ulii intra calendas descende,
     Auda viator, et terrestre centrum attinges.
     uod feci, Arne Saknussemm.

Which bad atin may be translated thus:

escend, bold traveller, into the crater of the okul of Sneffels,
which the shadow of Scartaris touches before the kalends of uly, and
you will attain the centre of the earth which  have done, Arne
Saknussemm.

n reading this, my uncle gave a spring as if he had touched a eyden
ar. is audacity, his oy, and his convictions were magnificent to
behold. e came and he went he seied his head between both his
hands he pushed the chairs out of their places, he piled up his
books incredible as it may seem, he rattled his precious nodules of
flints together he sent a kick here, a thump there. At last his
nerves calmed down, and like a man ehausted by too lavish an
ependiture of vital power, he sank back ehausted into his armchair.

What o'clock is it? he asked after a few moments of silence.

Three o'clock,  replied.

half dead with hunger. Come on, and after dinner

ECTG SCSSS AT A AAEE ETESE


At these words a cold shiver ran through me. et  controlled myself
 even resolved to put a good face upon it. Scientific arguments
alone could have any weight with rofessor iedenbrock. ow there
were good ones against the practicability of such a ourney.
enetrate to the centre of the earth What nonsense ut  kept my
dialectic battery in reserve for a suitable opportunity, and 
interested myself in the prospect of my dinner, which was not yet
forthcoming.

t is no use to tell of the rage and imprecations of my uncle before
the empty table. Eplanations were given, Martha was set at liberty,
ran off to the market, and did her part so well that in an hour
afterwards my hunger was appeased, and  was able to return to the
contemplation of the gravity of the situation.

uring all dinner time my uncle was almost merry he indulged in some
of those learned okes which never do anybody any harm. essert over,
he beckoned me into his study.

 obeyed he sat at one end of his table,  at the other.

Ael, said he very mildly you are a very ingenious young man, you
have done me a splendid service, at a moment when, wearied out with
the struggle,  was going to abandon the contest. Where should  have
lost myself? one can tell. ever, my lad, shall  forget it and you
shall have your share in the glory to which your discovery will lead.

h, come thought , he is in a good way. ow is the time for
discussing that same glory.

efore all things, my uncle resumed,  enoin you to preserve the
most inviolable secrecy: you understand? There are not a few in the
scientific world who envy my success, and many would be ready to
undertake this enterprise, to whom our return should be the first
news of it.

o you really think there are many people bold enough? said .

Certainly who would hesitate to acuire such renown? f that
document were divulged, a whole army of geologists would be ready to
rush into the footsteps of Arne Saknussemm.

 don't feel so very sure of that, uncle,  replied for we have
no proof of the authenticity of this document.

What not of the book, inside which we have discovered it?

Granted.  admit that Saknussemm may have written these lines. ut
does it follow that he has really accomplished such a ourney? And
may it not be that this old parchment is intended to mislead?

 almost regretted having uttered this last word, which dropped from
me in an unguarded moment. The rofessor bent his shaggy brows, and 
feared  had seriously compromised my own safety. appily no great
harm came of it. A smile flitted across the lip of my severe
companion, and he answered:

That is what we shall see.

Ah said , rather put out. ut do let me ehaust all the possible
obections against this document.

Speak, my boy, don't be afraid. ou are uite at liberty to epress
your opinions. ou are no longer my nephew only, but my colleague.
ray go on.

Well, in the first place,  wish to ask what are this okul, this
Sneffels, and this Scartaris, names which  have never heard before?

othing easier.  received not long ago a map from my friend,
Augustus etermann, at iepig. othing could be more apropos. Take
down the third atlas in the second shelf in the large bookcase,
series Z, plate .

 rose, and with the help of such precise instructions could not fail
to find the reuired atlas. My uncle opened it and said:

ere is one of the best maps of celand, that of andersen, and 
believe this will solve the worst of our difficulties.

 bent over the map.

ou see this volcanic island, said the rofessor observe that all
the volcanoes are called okuls, a word which means glacier in
celandic, and under the high latitude of celand nearly all the
active volcanoes discharge through beds of ice. ence this term of
okul is applied to all the eruptive mountains in celand.

ery good, said  but what of Sneffels?

 was hoping that this uestion would be unanswerable but  was
mistaken. My uncle replied:

Follow my finger along the west coast of celand. o you see
ekiavik, the capital? ou do. Well ascend the innumerable fiords
that indent those seabeaten shores, and stop at the sityfifth
degree of latitude. What do you see there?

 see a peninsula looking like a thigh bone with the knee bone at
the end of it.

A very fair comparison, my lad. ow do you see anything upon that
knee bone?

es a mountain rising out of the sea.

ight. That is Snfell.

That Snfell?

t is. t is a mountain five thousand feet high, one of the most
remarkable in the world, if its crater leads down to the centre of
the earth.

ut that is impossible,  said shrugging my shoulders, and
disgusted at such a ridiculous supposition.

mpossible? said the rofessor severely and why, pray?

ecause this crater is evidently filled with lava and burning rocks,
and therefore

ut suppose it is an etinct volcano?

Etinct?

es the number of active volcanoes on the surface of the globe is
at the present time only about three hundred. ut there is a very
much larger number of etinct ones. ow, Snfell is one of these.
Since historic times there has been but one eruption of this
mountain, that of  from that time it has uieted down more and
more, and now it is no longer reckoned among active volcanoes.

To such positive statements  could make no reply.  therefore took
refuge in other dark passages of the document.

What is the meaning of this word Scartaris, and what have the
kalends of uly to do with it?

My uncle took a few minutes to consider. For one short moment  felt
a ray of hope, speedily to be etinguished. For he soon answered thus:

What is darkness to you is light to me. This proves the ingenious
care with which Saknussemm guarded and defined his discovery.
Sneffels, or Snfell, has several craters. t was therefore necessary
to point out which of these leads to the centre of the globe. What
did the celandic sage do? e observed that at the approach of the
kalends of uly, that is to say in the last days of une, one of the
peaks, called Scartaris, flung its shadow down the mouth of that
particular crater, and he committed that fact to his document. Could
there possibly have been a more eact guide? As soon as we have
arrived at the summit of Snfell we shall have no hesitation as to
the proper road to take.

ecidedly, my uncle had answered every one of my obections.  saw
that his position on the old parchment was impregnable.  therefore
ceased to press him upon that part of the subect, and as above all
things he must be convinced,  passed on to scientific obections,
which in my opinion were far more serious.

Well, then,  said,  am forced to admit that Saknussemm's
sentence is clear, and leaves no room for doubt.  will even allow
that the document bears every mark and evidence of authenticity. That
learned philosopher did get to the bottom of Sneffels, he has seen
the shadow of Scartaris touch the edge of the crater before the
kalends of uly he may even have heard the legendary stories told in
his day about that crater reaching to the centre of the world but as
for reaching it himself, as for performing the ourney, and
returning, if he ever went,  say nohe never, never did that.

ow for your reason? said my uncle ironically.

All the theories of science demonstrate such a feat to be
impracticable.

The theories say that, do they? replied the rofessor in the tone
of a meek disciple. h unpleasant theories ow the theories will
hinder us, won't they?

 saw that he was only laughing at me but  went on all the same.

es it is perfectly well known that the internal temperature rises
one degree for every  feet in depth now, admitting this proportion
to be constant, and the radius of the earth being fifteen hundred
leagues, there must be a temperature of , degrees at the centre
of the earth. Therefore, all the substances that compose the body of
this earth must eist there in a state of incandescent gas for the
metals that most resist the action of heat, gold, and platinum, and
the hardest rocks, can never be either solid or liuid under such a
temperature.  have therefore good reason for asking if it is
possible to penetrate through such a medium.

So, Ael, it is the heat that troubles you?

f course it is. Were we to reach a depth of thirty miles we should
have arrived at the limit of the terrestrial crust, for there the
temperature will be more than  degrees.

Are you afraid of being put into a state of fusion?

 will leave you to decide that uestion,  answered rather
sullenly. This is my decision, replied rofessor iedenbrock,
putting on one of his grandest airs. either you nor anybody else
knows with any certainty what is going on in the interior of this
globe, since not the twelve thousandth part of its radius is known
science is eminently perfectible and every new theory is soon routed
by a newer. Was it not always believed until Fourier that the
temperature of the interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually? and
is it not known at the present time that the greatest cold of the
ethereal regions is never lower than  degrees below ero Fahr.? Why
should it not be the same with the internal heat? Why should it not,
at a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to
such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?

As my uncle was now taking his stand upon hypotheses, of course,
there was nothing to be said.

Well,  will tell you that true savants, amongst them oisson, have
demonstrated that if a heat of , degrees  eisted in the
interior of the globe, the fiery gases arising from the fused matter
would acuire an elastic force which the crust of the earth would be
unable to resist, and that it would eplode like the plates of a
bursting boiler.

That is oisson's opinion, my uncle, nothing more.

Granted. ut it is likewise the creed adopted by other distinguished
geologists, that the interior of the globe is neither gas nor water,
nor any of the heaviest minerals known, for in none of these cases
would the earth weigh what it does.

h, with figures you may prove anything

ut is it the same with facts s it not known that the number of
volcanoes has diminished since the first days of creation? and if
there is central heat may we not thence conclude that it is in
process of diminution?

My good uncle, if you will enter into the legion of speculation, 
can discuss the matter no longer.

ut  have to tell you that the highest names have come to the
support of my views. o you remember a visit paid to me by the
celebrated chemist, umphry avy, in ?

ot at all, for  was not born until nineteen years afterwards.

Well, umphry avy did call upon me on his way through amburg. We
were long engaged in discussing, amongst other problems, the
hypothesis of the liuid structure of the terrestrial nucleus. We
were agreed that it could not be in a liuid state, for a reason
which science has never been able to confute.

 The degrees of temperature are given by ules erne according to
the centigrade system, for which we will in each case substitute the
Fahrenheit measurement. Tr.

What is that reason?  said, rather astonished.

ecause this liuid mass would be subect, like the ocean, to the
lunar attraction, and therefore twice every day there would be
internal tides, which, upheaving the terrestrial crust, would cause
periodical earthuakes

et it is evident that the surface of the globe has been subect to
the action of fire,  replied, and it is uite reasonable to
suppose that the eternal crust cooled down first, whilst the heat
took refuge down to the centre.

uite a mistake, my uncle answered. The earth has been heated by
combustion on its surface, that is all. ts surface was composed of a
great number of metals, such as potassium and sodium, which have the
peculiar property of igniting at the mere contact with air and water
these metals kindled when the atmospheric vapours fell in rain upon
the soil and by and by, when the waters penetrated into the fissures
of the crust of the earth, they broke out into fresh combustion with
eplosions and eruptions. Such was the cause of the numerous
volcanoes at the origin of the earth.

pon my word, this is a very clever hypothesis,  eclaimed, in
spite rather of myself.

And which umphry avy demonstrated to me by a simple eperiment. e
formed a small ball of the metals which  have named, and which was a
very fair representation of our globe whenever he caused a fine dew
of rain to fall upon its surface, it heaved up into little
monticules, it became oydied and formed miniature mountains a
crater broke open at one of its summits the eruption took place, and
communicated to the whole of the ball such a heat that it could not
be held in the hand.

n truth,  was beginning to be shaken by the rofessor's arguments,
besides which he gave additional weight to them by his usual ardour
and fervent enthusiasm.

ou see, Ael, he added, the condition of the terrestrial nucleus
has given rise to various hypotheses among geologists there is no
proof at all for this internal heat my opinion is that there is no
such thing, it cannot be besides we shall see for ourselves, and,
like Arne Saknussemm, we shall know eactly what to hold as truth
concerning this grand uestion.

ery well, we shall see,  replied, feeling myself carried off by
his contagious enthusiasm. es, we shall see that is, if it is
possible to see anything there.

And why not? May we not depend upon electric phenomena to give us
light? May we not even epect light from the atmosphere, the pressure
of which may render it luminous as we approach the centre?

es, yes, said  that is possible, too.

t is certain, eclaimed my uncle in a tone of triumph. ut
silence, do you hear me? silence upon the whole subect and let no
one get before us in this design of discovering the centre of the
earth.

A WMA'S CAGE


Thus ended this memorable seance. That conversation threw me into a
fever.  came out of my uncle's study as if  had been stunned, and
as if there was not air enough in all the streets of amburg to put
me right again.  therefore made for the banks of the Elbe, where the
steamer lands her passengers, which forms the communication between
the city and the amburg railway.

Was  convinced of the truth of what  had heard? ad  not bent
under the iron rule of the rofessor iedenbrock? Was  to believe
him in earnest in his intention to penetrate to the centre of this
massive globe? ad  been listening to the mad speculations of a
lunatic, or to the scientific conclusions of a lofty genius? Where
did truth stop? Where did error begin?

 was all adrift amongst a thousand contradictory hypotheses, but 
could not lay hold of one.

et  remembered that  had been convinced, although now my
enthusiasm was beginning to cool down but  felt a desire to start
at once, and not to lose time and courage by calm reflection.  had
at that moment uite courage enough to strap my knapsack to my
shoulders and start.

ut  must confess that in another hour this unnatural ecitement
abated, my nerves became unstrung, and from the depths of the abysses
of this earth  ascended to its surface again.

t is uite absurd  cried, there is no sense about it. o
sensible young man should for a moment entertain such a proposal. The
whole thing is noneistent.  have had a bad night,  have been
dreaming of horrors.

ut  had followed the banks of the Elbe and passed the town. After
passing the port too,  had reached the Altona road.  was led by a
presentiment, soon to be realised for shortly  espied my little
Gruben bravely returning with her light step to amburg.

Gruben  cried from afar off.

The young girl stopped, rather frightened perhaps to hear her name
called after her on the high road. Ten yards more, and  had oined
her.

Ael she cried surprised. What have you come to meet me? s this
why you are here, sir?

ut when she had looked upon me, Gruben could not fail to see the
uneasiness and distress of my mind.

What is the matter? she said, holding out her hand.

What is the matter, Gruben?  cried.

n a couple of minutes my pretty irlandaise was fully informed of
the position of affairs. For a time she was silent. id her heart
palpitate as mine did?  don't know about that, but  know that her
hand did not tremble in mine. We went on a hundred yards without
speaking.

At last she said, Ael

My dear Gruben.

es, Ael, a ourney worthy of the nephew of a savant it is a good
thing for a man to be distinguished by some great enterprise.

What, Gruben, won't you dissuade me from such an undertaking?

o, my dear Ael, and  would willingly go with you, but that a poor
girl would only be in your way.

s that uite true?

t is true.

Ah women and young girls, how incomprehensible are your feminine
hearts When you are not the timidest, you are the bravest of
creatures. eason has nothing to do with your actions. What did this
child encourage me in such an epedition Would she not be afraid to

 was disconcerted, and, if  must tell the whole truth,  was
ashamed.

Gruben, we will see whether you will say the same thing tomorrow.

Tomorrow, dear Ael,  will say what  say today.

Gruben and , hand in hand, but in silence, pursued our way. The
emotions of that day were breaking my heart.

After all,  thought, the kalends of uly are a long way off, and
between this and then many things may take place which will cure my
uncle of his desire to travel underground.

t was night when we arrived at the house in nigstrasse.  epected
to find all uiet there, my uncle in bed as was his custom, and
Martha giving her last touches with the feather brush.

old servant was at her wits' end.

gone out for a walk instead of hurrying your preparations forward?

Are we to go?  asked again, with sinking hopes.

 could hear no more.  fled for refuge into my own little room.

All hope was now at an end. My uncle had been all the morning making
purchases of a part of the tools and apparatus reuired for this
desperate undertaking. The passage was encumbered with rope ladders,
knotted cords, torches, flasks, grappling irons, alpenstocks,
pickaes, iron shod sticks, enough to load ten men.

into the rofessor's study.

Why do you doubt?

is there to hurry?

Time, time, flying with irreparable rapidity.

Well, if we waited for the nd une we should be too late to see
the shadow of Scartaris touch the crater of Sneffels. Therefore we
must get to Copenhagen as fast as we can to secure our passage. Go
and pack up.

There was no reply to this.  went up to my room. Gruben followed
me. She undertook to pack up all things necessary for my voyage. She
was no more moved than if  had been starting for a little trip to
beck or eligoland. er little hands moved without haste. She
talked uietly. She supplied me with sensible reasons for our
epedition. She delighted me, and yet  was angry with her. ow and
then  felt  ought to break out into a passion, but she took no
notice and went on her way as methodically as ever.

Finally the last strap was buckled  came downstairs. All that day
the philosophical instrument makers and the electricians kept coming
and going. Martha was distracted.

And is he going to take you with him?

 nodded again.

Where to?

 pointed with my finger downward.

own into the cellar? cried the old servant.

o,  said. ower down than that.

ight came. ut  knew nothing about the lapse of time.

Tomorrow morning at si precisely, my uncle decreed we start.

At ten o'clock  fell upon my bed, a dead lump of inert matter. All
through the night terror had hold of me.  spent it dreaming of
abysses.  was a prey to delirium.  felt myself grasped by the
rofessor's sinewy hand, dragged along, hurled down, shattered into
little bits.  dropped down unfathomable precipices with the
accelerating velocity of bodies falling through space. My life had
become an endless fall.  awoke at five with shattered nerves,
trembling and weary.  came downstairs. My uncle was at table,
devouring his breakfast.  stared at him with horror and disgust. ut
dear Gruben was there so  said nothing, and could eat nothing.

At halfpast five there was a rattle of wheels outside. A large
carriage was there to take us to the Altona railway station. t was
soon piled up with my uncle's multifarious preparations.

Where's your bo? he cried.

t is ready,  replied, with faltering voice.

Then make haste down, or we shall lose the train.

t was now manifestly impossible to maintain the struggle against
destiny.  went up again to my room, and rolling my portmanteaus
downstairs  darted after him.

At that moment my uncle was solemnly investing Gruben with the reins
of government. My pretty irlandaise was as calm and collected as was
her wont. She kissed her guardian but could not restrain a tear in
touching my cheek with her gentle lips.

Gruben  murmured.

Go, my dear Ael, go  am now your betrothed and when you come
back  will be your wife.

 pressed her in my arms and took my place in the carriage. Martha
and the young girl, standing at the door, waved their last farewell.
Then the horses, roused by the driver's whistling, darted off at a
gallop on the road to Altona.

SES EAATS F ETCA ESCET


Altona, which is but a suburb of amburg, is the terminus of the iel
railway, which was to carry us to the elts. n twenty minutes we
were in olstein.

At halfpast si the carriage stopped at the station my uncle's
numerous packages, his voluminous impedimenta, were unloaded,
removed, labelled, weighed, put into the luggage vans, and at seven
we were seated face to face in our compartment. The whistle sounded,
the engine started, we were off.

Was  resigned? o, not yet. et the cool morning air and the scenes
on the road, rapidly changed by the swiftness of the train, drew me
away somewhat from my sad reflections.

As for the rofessor's reflections, they went far in advance of the
swiftest epress. We were alone in the carriage, but we sat in
silence. My uncle eamined all his pockets and his travelling bag
with the minutest care.  saw that he had not forgotten the smallest
matter of detail.

Amongst other documents, a sheet of paper, carefully folded, bore the
heading of the anish consulate with the signature of W.
Christiensen, consul at amburg and the rofessor's friend. With this
we possessed the proper introductions to the Governor of celand.

 also observed the famous document most carefully laid up in a
secret pocket in his portfolio.  bestowed a malediction upon it, and
then proceeded to eamine the country.

t was a very long succession of uninteresting loamy and fertile
flats, a very easy country for the construction of railways, and
propitious for the layingdown of these direct level lines so dear to
railway companies.

 had no time to get tired of the monotony for in three hours we
stopped at iel, close to the sea.

The luggage being labelled for Copenhagen, we had no occasion to look
after it. et the rofessor watched every article with ealous
vigilance, until all were safe on board. There they disappeared in
the hold.

My uncle, notwithstanding his hurry, had so well calculated the
relations between the train and the steamer that we had a whole day
to spare. The steamer Ellenora, did not start until night. Thence
sprang a feverish state of ecitement in which the impatient
irascible traveller devoted to perdition the railway directors and
the steamboat companies and the governments which allowed such
intolerable slowness.  was obliged to act chorus to him when he
attacked the captain of the Ellenora upon this subect. The captain
disposed of us summarily.

At iel, as elsewhere, we must do something to while away the time.
What with walking on the verdant shores of the bay within which
nestles the little town, eploring the thick woods which make it look
like a nest embowered amongst thick foliage, admiring the villas,
each provided with a little bathing house, and moving about and
grumbling, at last ten o'clock came.

The heavy coils of smoke from the Ellenora's funnel unrolled in the
sky, the bridge shook with the uivering of the struggling steam we
were on board, and owners for the time of two berths, one over the
other, in the only saloon cabin on board.

At a uarter past the moorings were loosed and the throbbing steamer
pursued her way over the dark waters of the Great elt.

The night was dark there was a sharp breee and a rough sea, a few
lights appeared on shore through the thick darkness later on, 
cannot tell when, a daling light from some lighthouse threw a
bright stream of fire along the waves and this is all  can remember
of this first portion of our sail.

At seven in the morning we landed at orsor, a small town on the west
coast of Zealand. There we were transferred from the boat to another
line of railway, which took us by ust as flat a country as the plain
of olstein.

Three hours' travelling brought us to the capital of enmark. My
uncle had not shut his eyes all night. n his impatience  believe he
was trying to accelerate the train with his feet.

At last he discerned a stretch of sea.

The Sound he cried.

At our left was a huge building that looked like a hospital.

That's a lunatic asylum, said one of or travelling companions.

ery good thought , ust the place we want to end our days in and
great as it is, that asylum is not big enough to contain all
rofessor iedenbrock's madness

At ten in the morning, at last, we set our feet in Copenhagen the
luggage was put upon a carriage and taken with ourselves to the
hoeni otel in reda Gate. This took half an hour, for the station
is out of the town. Then my uncle, after a hasty toilet, dragged me
after him. The porter at the hotel could speak German and English
but the rofessor, as a polyglot, uestioned him in good anish, and
it was in the same language that that personage directed him to the
Museum of orthern Antiuities.

The curator of this curious establishment, in which wonders are
gathered together out of which the ancient history of the country
might be reconstructed by means of its stone weapons, its cups and
its ewels, was a learned savant, the friend of the anish consul at
amburg, rofessor Thomsen.

My uncle had a cordial letter of introduction to him. As a general
rule one savant greets another with coolness. ut here the case was
different. M. Thomsen, like a good friend, gave the rofessor
iedenbrock a cordial greeting, and he even vouchsafed the same
kindness to his nephew. t is hardly necessary to say the secret was
sacredly kept from the ecellent curator we were simply
disinterested travellers visiting celand out of harmless curiosity.

M. Thomsen placed his services at our disposal, and we visited the
uays with the obect of finding out the net vessel to sail.

 was yet in hopes that there would be no means of getting to
celand. ut there was no such luck. A small anish schooner, the
alkyria, was to set sail for ekiavik on the nd of une. The
captain, M. arne, was on board. is intending passenger was so
oyful that he almost sueeed his hands till they ached. That good
man was rather surprised at his energy. To him it seemed a very
simple thing to go to celand, as that was his business but to my
uncle it was sublime. The worthy captain took advantage of his
enthusiasm to charge double fares but we did not trouble ourselves
about mere trifles. .

ou must be on board on Tuesday, at seven in the morning, said
Captain arne, after having pocketed more dollars than were his due.

Then we thanked M. Thomsen for his kindness, and we returned to the
hoeni otel.

t's all right, it's all right, my uncle repeated. ow fortunate
we are to have found this boat ready for sailing. ow let us have
some breakfast and go about the town.

We went first to ongensnyeTorw, an irregular suare in which are
two innocentlooking guns, which need not alarm any one. Close by, at
o. , there was a French restaurant, kept by a cook of the name of
incent, where we had an ample breakfast for four marks each s.
d..

Then  took a childish pleasure in eploring the city my uncle let
me take him with me, but he took notice of nothing, neither the
insignificant king's palace, nor the pretty seventeenth century
bridge, which spans the canal before the museum, nor that immense
cenotaph of Thorwaldsen's, adorned with horrible mural painting, and
containing within it a collection of the sculptor's works, nor in a
fine park the toylike chateau of osenberg, nor the beautiful
renaissance edifice of the Echange, nor its spire composed of the
twisted tails of four brone dragons, nor the great windmill on the
ramparts, whose huge arms dilated in the sea breee like the sails of
a ship.

What delicious walks we should have had together, my pretty
irlandaise and , along the harbour where the twodeckers and the
frigate slept peaceably by the red roofing of the warehouse, by the
green banks of the strait, through the deep shades of the trees
amongst which the fort is half concealed, where the guns are
thrusting out their black throats between branches of alder and
willow.

ut, alas Gruben was far away and  never hoped to see her again.

ut if my uncle felt no attraction towards these romantic scenes he
was very much struck with the aspect of a certain church spire
situated in the island of Amak, which forms the southwest uarter of
Copenhagen.

 was ordered to direct my feet that way  embarked on a small
steamer which plies on the canals, and in a few minutes she touched
the uay of the dockyard.

After crossing a few narrow streets where some convicts, in trousers
half yellow and half grey, were at work under the orders of the
gangers, we arrived at the or Frelsers irk. There was nothing
remarkable about the church but there was a reason why its tall
spire had attracted the rofessor's attention. Starting from the top
of the tower, an eternal staircase wound around the spire, the
spirals circling up into the sky.

et us get to the top, said my uncle.

 shall be diy,  said.

The more reason why we should go up we must get used to it.

ut

Come,  tell you don't waste our time.

 had to obey. A keeper who lived at the other end of the street
handed us the key, and the ascent began.

My uncle went ahead with a light step.  followed him not without
alarm, for my head was very apt to feel diy  possessed neither
the euilibrium of an eagle nor his fearless nature.

As long as we were protected on the inside of the winding staircase
up the tower, all was well enough but after toiling up a hundred and
fifty steps the fresh air came to salute my face, and we were on the
leads of the tower. There the aerial staircase began its gyrations,
only guarded by a thin iron rail, and the narrowing steps seemed to
ascend into infinite space

ever shall  be able to do it,  said.

on't be a coward come up, sir said my uncle with the coldest
cruelty.

 had to follow, clutching at every step. The keen air made me giddy
 felt the spire rocking with every gust of wind my knees began to
fail soon  was crawling on my knees, then creeping on my stomach 
closed my eyes  seemed to be lost in space.

At last  reached the ape, with the assistance of my uncle dragging
me up by the collar.

 opened my eyes.  saw houses suashed flat as if they had all
fallen down from the skies a smoke fog seemed to drown them. ver my
head ragged clouds were drifting past, and by an optical inversion
they seemed stationary, while the steeple, the ball and  were all
spinning along with fantastic speed. Far away on one side was the
green country, on the other the sea sparkled, bathed in sunlight. The
Sound stretched away to Elsinore, dotted with a few white sails, like
seagulls' wings and in the misty east and away to the northeast
lay outstretched the faintlyshadowed shores of Sweden. All this
immensity of space whirled and wavered, fluctuating beneath my eyes.

ut  was compelled to rise, to stand up, to look. My first lesson in
diiness lasted an hour. When  got permission to come down and feel
the solid street pavements  was afflicted with severe lumbago.

Tomorrow we will do it again, said the rofessor.

And it was so for five days in succession,  was obliged to undergo
this antivertiginous eercise and whether  would or not,  made
some improvement in the art of lofty contemplations.




CATE .

CEA T WAT ET?


The day for our departure arrived. The day before it our kind friend
M. Thomsen brought us letters of introduction to Count Trampe, the
Governor of celand, M. icturssen, the bishop's suffragan, and M.
Finsen, mayor of ekiavik. My uncle epressed his gratitude by
tremendous compressions of both his hands.

n the nd, at si in the evening, all our precious baggage being
safely on board the alkyria, the captain took us into a very
narrow cabin.

s the wind favourable? my uncle asked.

Ecellent, replied Captain arne a sou'easter. We shall pass
down the Sound full speed, with all sails set.

n a few minutes the schooner, under her mien, brigantine, topsail,
and topgallant sail, loosed from her moorings and made full sail
through the straits. n an hour the capital of enmark seemed to sink
below the distant waves, and the alkyria was skirting the coast by
Elsinore. n my nervous frame of mind  epected to see the ghost of
amlet wandering on the legendary castle terrace.

Sublime madman  said, no doubt you would approve of our
epedition. erhaps you would keep us company to the centre of the
globe, to find the solution of your eternal doubts.

ut there was no ghostly shape upon the ancient walls. ndeed, the
castle is much younger than the heroic prince of enmark. t now
answers the purpose of a sumptuous lodge for the doorkeeper of the
straits of the Sound, before which every year there pass fifteen
thousand ships of all nations.

The castle of ronsberg soon disappeared in the mist, as well as the
tower of elsingborg, built on the Swedish coast, and the schooner
passed lightly on her way urged by the breees of the Cattegat.

The alkyria was a splendid sailer, but on a sailing vessel you can
place no dependence. She was taking to ekiavik coal, household
goods, earthenware, woollen clothing, and a cargo of wheat. The crew
consisted of five men, all anes.

ow long will the passage take? my uncle asked.

Ten days, the captain replied, if we don't meet a nor'wester in
passing the Faroes.

ut are you not subect to considerable delays?

o, M. iedenbrock, don't be uneasy, we shall get there in very good
time.

At evening the schooner doubled the Skaw at the northern point of
enmark, in the night passed the Skager ack, skirted orway by Cape
indness, and entered the orth Sea.

n two days more we sighted the coast of Scotland near eterhead, and
the alkyria turned her lead towards the Faroe slands, passing
between the rkneys and Shetlands.

Soon the schooner encountered the great Atlantic swell she had to
tack against the north wind, and reached the Faroes only with some
difficulty. n the th the captain made out Myganness, the
southernmost of these islands, and from that moment took a straight
course for Cape ortland, the most southerly point of celand.

The passage was marked by nothing unusual.  bore the troubles of the
sea pretty well my uncle, to his own intense disgust, and his
greater shame, was ill all through the voyage.

e therefore was unable to converse with the captain about Snfell,
the way to get to it, the facilities for transport, he was obliged to
put off these inuiries until his arrival, and spent all his time at
full length in his cabin, of which the timbers creaked and shook with
every pitch she took. t must be confessed he was not undeserving of
his punishment.

n the th we reached Cape ortland. The clear open weather gave us
a good view of Myrdals okul, which overhangs it. The cape is merely
a low hill with steep sides, standing lonely by the beach.

The alkyria kept at some distance from the coast, taking a
westerly course amidst great shoals of whales and sharks. Soon we
came in sight of an enormous perforated rock, through which the sea
dashed furiously. The Westman islets seemed to rise out of the ocean
like a group of rocks in a liuid plain. From that time the schooner
took a wide berth and swept at a great distance round Cape
ekianess, which forms the western point of celand.

The rough sea prevented my uncle from coming on deck to admire these
shattered and surfbeaten coasts.

Fortyeight hours after, coming out of a storm which forced the
schooner to scud under bare poles, we sighted east of us the beacon
on Cape Skagen, where dangerous rocks etend far away seaward. An
celandic pilot came on board, and in three hours the alkyria
dropped her anchor before ekiavik, in Faa ay.

The rofessor at last emerged from his cabin, rather pale and
wretchedlooking, but still full of enthusiasm, and with ardent
satisfaction shining in his eyes.

The population of the town, wonderfully interested in the arrival of
a vessel from which every one epected something, formed in groups
upon the uay.

My uncle left in haste his floating prison, or rather hospital. ut
before uitting the deck of the schooner he dragged me forward, and
pointing with outstretched finger north of the bay at a distant
mountain terminating in a double peak, a pair of cones covered with
perpetual snow, he cried:

Snfell Snfell

Then recommending me, by an impressive gesture, to keep silence, he
went into the boat which awaited him.  followed, and presently we
were treading the soil of celand.

The first man we saw was a goodlooking fellow enough, in a general's
uniform. et he was not a general but a magistrate, the Governor of
the island, M. le aron Trampe himself. The rofessor was soon aware
of the presence he was in. e delivered him his letters from
Copenhagen, and then followed a short conversation in the anish
language, the purport of which  was uite ignorant of, and for a
very good reason. ut the result of this first conversation was, that
aron Trampe placed himself entirely at the service of rofessor
iedenbrock.

My uncle was ust as courteously received by the mayor, M. Finsen,
whose appearance was as military, and disposition and office as
pacific, as the Governor's.

As for the bishop's suffragan, M. icturssen, he was at that moment
engaged on an episcopal visitation in the north. For the time we must
be resigned to wait for the honour of being presented to him. ut M.
Fridrikssen, professor of natural sciences at the school of
ekiavik, was a delightful man, and his friendship became very
precious to me. This modest philosopher spoke only anish and atin.
e came to proffer me his good offices in the language of orace, and
 felt that we were made to understand each other. n fact he was the
only person in celand with whom  could converse at all.

This goodnatured gentleman made over to us two of the three rooms
which his house contained, and we were soon installed in it with all
our luggage, the abundance of which rather astonished the good people
of ekiavik.

Well, Ael, said my uncle, we are getting on, and now the worst is
over.

The worst  said, astonished.

To be sure, now we have nothing to do but go down.

h, if that is all, you are uite right but after all, when we have
gone down, we shall have to get up again,  suppose?

h  don't trouble myself about that. Come, there's no time to lose
 am going to the library. erhaps there is some manuscript of
Saknussemm's there, and  should be glad to consult it.

Well, while you are there  will go into the town. Won't you?

h, that is very uninteresting to me. t is not what is upon this
island, but what is underneath, that interests me.

 went out, and wandered wherever chance took me.

t would not be easy to lose your way in ekiavik.  was therefore
under no necessity to inuire the road, which eposes one to mistakes
when the only medium of intercourse is gesture.

The town etends along a low and marshy level, between two hills. An
immense bed of lava bounds it on one side, and falls gently towards
the sea. n the other etends the vast bay of Faa, shut in at the
north by the enormous glacier of the Snfell, and of which the
alkyria was for the time the only occupant. sually the English
and French conservators of fisheries moor in this bay, but ust then
they were cruising about the western coasts of the island.

The longest of the only two streets that ekiavik possesses was
parallel with the beach. ere live the merchants and traders, in
wooden cabins made of red planks set horiontally the other street,
running west, ends at the little lake between the house of the bishop
and other noncommercial people.

 had soon eplored these melancholy ways here and there  got a
glimpse of faded turf, looking like a wornout bit of carpet, or some
appearance of a kitchen garden, the sparse vegetables of which
potatoes, cabbages, and lettuces, would have figured appropriately
upon a illiputian table. A few sickly wallflowers were trying to
enoy the air and sunshine.

About the middle of the tincommercial street  found the public
cemetery, inclosed with a mud wall, and where there seemed plenty of
room.

Then a few steps brought me to the Governor's house, a but compared
with the town hall of amburg, a palace in comparison with the cabins
of the celandic population.

etween the little lake and the town the church is built in the
rotestant style, of calcined stones etracted out of the volcanoes
by their own labour and at their own epense in high westerly winds
it was manifest that the red tiles of the roof would be scattered in
the air, to the great danger of the faithful worshippers.

n a neighbouring hill  perceived the national school, where, as 
was informed later by our host, were taught ebrew, English, French,
and anish, four languages of which, with shame  confess it,  don't
know a single word after an eamination  should have had to stand
last of the forty scholars educated at this little college, and 
should have been held unworthy to sleep along with them in one of
those little double closets, where more delicate youths would have
died of suffocation the very first night.

n three hours  had seen not only the town but its environs. The
general aspect was wonderfully dull. o trees, and scarcely any
vegetation. Everywhere bare rocks, signs of volcanic action. The
celandic huts are made of earth and turf, and the walls slope
inward they rather resemble roofs placed on the ground. ut then
these roofs are meadows of comparative fertility. Thanks to the
internal heat, the grass grows on them to some degree of perfection.
t is carefully mown in the hay season if it were not, the horses
would come to pasture on these green abodes.

n my ecursion  met but few people. n returning to the main street
 found the greater part of the population busied in drying, salting,
and putting on board codfish, their chief eport. The men looked like
robust but heavy, blond Germans with pensive eyes, conscious of being
far removed from their fellow creatures, poor eiles relegated to
this land of ice, poor creatures who should have been Esuimau,
since nature had condemned them to live only ust outside the arctic
circle n vain did  try to detect a smile upon their lips
sometimes by a spasmodic and involuntary contraction of the muscles
they seemed to laugh, but they never smiled.

Their costume consisted of a coarse acket of black woollen cloth
called in Scandinavian lands a 'vadmel,' a hat with a very broad
brim, trousers with a narrow edge of red, and a bit of leather rolled
round the foot for shoes.

The women looked as sad and as resigned as the men their faces were
agreeable but epressionless, and they wore gowns and petticoats of
dark 'vadmel' as maidens, they wore over their braided hair a little
knitted brown cap when married, they put around their heads a
coloured handkerchief, crowned with a peak of white linen.

After a good walk  returned to M. Fridrikssen's house, where  found
my uncle already in his host's company.

inner was ready. rofessor iedenbrock devoured his portion
voraciously, for his compulsory fast on board had converted his
stomach into a vast unfathomable gulf. There was nothing remarkable
in the meal itself but the hospitality of our host, more anish than
celandic, reminded me of the heroes of old. t was evident that we
were more at home than he was himself.

The conversation was carried on in the vernacular tongue, which my
uncle mied with German and M. Fridrikssen with atin for my benefit.
t turned upon scientific uestions as befits philosophers but
rofessor iedenbrock was ecessively reserved, and at every sentence
spoke to me with his eyes, enoining the most absolute silence upon
our plans.

n the first place M. Fridrikssen wanted to know what success my
uncle had had at the library.

our library why there is nothing but a few tattered books upon
almost deserted shelves.

ndeed replied M. Fridrikssen, why we possess eight thousand
volumes, many of them valuable and scarce, works in the old
Scandinavian language, and we have all the novelties that Copenhagen
sends us every year.

Where do you keep your eight thousand volumes? For my part

h, M. iedenbrock, they are all over the country. n this icy
region we are fond of study. There is not a farmer nor a fisherman
that cannot read and does not read. ur principle is, that books,
instead of growing mouldy behind an iron grating, should be worn out
under the eyes of many readers. Therefore, these volumes are passed
from one to another, read over and over, referred to again and again
and it often happens that they find their way back to their shelves
only after an absence of a year or two.

And in the meantime, said my uncle rather spitefully, strangers

Well, what would you have? Foreigners have their libraries at home,
and the first essential for labouring people is that they should be
educated.  repeat to you the love of reading runs in celandic
blood. n  we founded a prosperous literary society learned
strangers think themselves honoured in becoming members of it. t
publishes books which educate our fellowcountrymen, and do the
country great service. f you will consent to be a corresponding
member, err iedenbrock, you will be giving us great pleasure.

My uncle, who had already oined about a hundred learned societies,
accepted with a grace which evidently touched M. Fridrikssen.

ow, said he, will you be kind enough to tell me what books you
hoped to find in our library and  may perhaps enable you to consult
them?

My uncle's eyes and mine met. e hesitated. This direct uestion went
to the root of the matter. ut after a moment's reflection he decided
on speaking.

Monsieur Fridrikssen,  wished to know if amongst your ancient books
you possessed any of the works of Arne Saknussemm?

Arne Saknussemm replied the ekiavik professor. ou mean that
learned siteenth century savant, a naturalist, a chemist, and a
traveller?

ust so

ne of the glories of celandic literature and science?

That's the man.

An illustrious man anywhere

uite so.

And whose courage was eual to his genius

 see that you know him well.

My uncle was bathed in delight at hearing his hero thus described. e
feasted his eyes upon M. Fridrikssen's face.

Well, he cried, where are his works?

is works, we have them not.

Whatnot in celand?

They are neither in celand nor anywhere else.

Why is that?

ecause Arne Saknussemm was persecuted for heresy, and in  his
books were burned by the hands of the common hangman.

ery good Ecellent cried my uncle, to the great scandal of the
professor of natural history.

What he cried.

es, yes now it is all clear, now it is all unravelled and  see
why Saknussemm, put into the nde Epurgatorius, and compelled to
hide the discoveries made by his genius, was obliged to bury in an
incomprehensible cryptogram the secret

What secret? asked M. Fridrikssen, starting.

h, ust a secret which my uncle stammered.

ave you some private document in your possession? asked our host.

o  was only supposing a case.

h, very well, answered M. Fridrikssen, who was kind enough not to
pursue the subect when he had noticed the embarrassment of his
friend.  hope you will not leave our island until you have seen
some of its mineralogical wealth.

Certainly, replied my uncle but  am rather late or have not
others been here before me?

es, err iedenbrock the labours of MM. lafsen and ovelsen,
pursued by order of the king, the researches of Trol the scientific
mission of MM. Gaimard and obert on the French corvette a
echerche,  and lately the observations of scientific men who
came in the eine ortense, have added materially to our knowledge
of celand. ut  assure you there is plenty left.

o you think so? said my uncle, pretending to look very modest, and
trying to hide the curiosity was flashing out of his eyes.

h, yes how many mountains, glaciers, and volcanoes there are to
study, which are as yet but imperfectly known Then, without going
any further, that mountain in the horion. That is Snfell.

Ah said my uncle, as coolly as he was able, is that Snfell?

es one of the most curious volcanoes, and the crater of which has
scarcely ever been visited.

s it etinct?

h, yes more than five hundred years.

Well, replied my uncle, who was frantically locking his legs together
to keep himself from umping up in the air, that is where  mean to
begin my geological studies, there on that SeffelFesselwhat do you
call it?

Snfell, replied the ecellent M. Fridrikssen.

This part of the conversation was in atin  had understood every
word of it, and  could hardly conceal my amusement at seeing my
uncle trying to keep down the ecitement and satisfaction which were
brimming over in every limb and every feature. e tried hard to put
on an innocent little epression of simplicity but it looked like a
diabolical grin.

 echerche was sent out in  by Admiral uperr to learn the
fate of the lost epedition of M. de losseville in the illoise
which has never been heard of.

es, said he, your words decide me. We will try to scale that
Snfell perhaps even we may pursue our studies in its crater

 am very sorry, said M. Fridrikssen, that my engagements will not
allow me to absent myself, or  would have accompanied you myself
with both pleasure and profit.

h, no, no replied my uncle with great animation, we would not
disturb any one for the world, M. Fridrikssen. Still,  thank you
with all my heart: the company of such a talented man would have been
very serviceable, but the duties of your profession

 am glad to think that our host, in the innocence of his celandic
soul, was blind to the transparent artifices of my uncle.

 very much approve of your beginning with that volcano, M.
iedenbrock. ou will gather a harvest of interesting observations.
ut, tell me, how do you epect to get to the peninsula of Snfell?

y sea, crossing the bay. That's the most direct way.

o doubt but it is impossible.

Why?

ecause we don't possess a single boat at ekiavik.

ou don't mean to say so?

ou will have to go by land, following the shore. t will be longer,
but more interesting.

ery well, then and now  shall have to see about a guide.

 have one to offer you.

A safe, intelligent man.

es an inhabitant of that peninsula. e is an eiderdown hunter, and
very clever. e speaks anish perfectly.

When can  see him?

Tomorrow, if you like.

Why not today?

ecause he won't be here till tomorrow.

Tomorrow, then, added my uncle with a sigh.

This momentous conversation ended in a few minutes with warm
acknowledgments paid by the German to the celandic rofessor. At
this dinner my uncle had ust elicited important facts, amongst
others, the history of Saknussemm, the reason of the mysterious
document, that his host would not accompany him in his epedition,
and that the very net day a guide would be waiting upon him.

A GE F T TE CETE F TE EAT


n the evening  took a short walk on the beach and returned at night
to my plankbed, where  slept soundly all night.

When  awoke  heard my uncle talking at a great rate in the net
room.  immediately dressed and oined him.

e was conversing in the anish language with a tall man, of robust
build. This fine fellow must have been possessed of great strength.
is eyes, set in a large and ingenuous face, seemed to me very
intelligent they were of a dreamy seablue. ong hair, which would
have been called red even in England, fell in long meshes upon his
broad shoulders. The movements of this native were lithe and supple
but he made little use of his arms in speaking, like a man who knew
nothing or cared nothing about the language of gestures. is whole
appearance bespoke perfect calmness and selfpossession, not
indolence but tranuillity. t was felt at once that he would be
beholden to nobody, that he worked for his own convenience, and that
nothing in this world could astonish or disturb his philosophic
calmness.

 caught the shades of this celander's character by the way in which
he listened to the impassioned flow of words which fell from the
rofessor. e stood with arms crossed, perfectly unmoved by my
uncle's incessant gesticulations. A negative was epressed by a slow
movement of the head from left to right, an affirmative by a slight
bend, so slight that his long hair scarcely moved. e carried economy
of motion even to parsimony.

Certainly  should never have dreamt in looking at this man that he
was a hunter he did not look likely to frighten his game, nor did he
seem as if he would even get near it. ut the mystery was eplained
when M. Fridrikssen informed me that this tranuil personage was only
a hunter of the eider duck, whose under plumage constitutes the chief
wealth of the island. This is the celebrated eider down, and it
reuires no great rapidity of movement to get it.

Early in summer the female, a very pretty bird, goes to build her
nest among the rocks of the fiords with which the coast is fringed.
After building the nest she feathers it with down plucked from her
own breast. mmediately the hunter, or rather the trader, comes and
robs the nest, and the female recommences her work. This goes on as
long as she has any down left. When she has stripped herself bare the
male takes his turn to pluck himself. ut as the coarse and hard
plumage of the male has no commercial value, the hunter does not take
the trouble to rob the nest of this the female therefore lays her
eggs in the spoils of her mate, the young are hatched, and net year
the harvest begins again.

ow, as the eider duck does not select steep cliffs for her nest, but
rather the smooth terraced rocks which slope to the sea, the
celandic hunter might eercise his calling without any inconvenient
eertion. e was a farmer who was not obliged either to sow or reap
his harvest, but merely to gather it in.

This grave, phlegmatic, and silent individual was called ans elke
and he came recommended by M. Fridrikssen. e was our future guide.
is manners were a singular contrast with my uncle's.

evertheless, they soon came to understand each other. either looked
at the amount of the payment: the one was ready to accept whatever
was offered the other was ready to give whatever was demanded. ever
was bargain more readily concluded.

The result of the treaty was, that ans engaged on his part to
conduct us to the village of Stapi, on the south shore of the Snfell
peninsula, at the very foot of the volcano. y land this would be
about twentytwo miles, to be done, said my uncle, in two days.

ut when he learnt that the anish mile was , feet long, he was
obliged to modify his calculations and allow seven or eight days for
the march.

Four horses were to be placed at our disposaltwo to carry him and
me, two for the baggage. ams, as was his custom, would go on foot.
e knew all that part of the coast perfectly, and promised to take us
the shortest way.

is engagement was not to terminate with our arrival at Stapi he was
to continue in my uncle's service for the whole period of his
scientific researches, for the remuneration of three ridales a week
about twelve shillings, but it was an epress article of the
covenant that his wages should be counted out to him every Saturday
at si o'clock in the evening, which, according to him, was one
indispensable part of the engagement.

The start was fied for the th of une. My uncle wanted to pay the
hunter a portion in advance, but he refused with one word:

Efter, said he.

After, said the rofessor for my edification.

The treaty concluded, ans silently withdrew.

A famous fellow, cried my uncle but he little thinks of the
marvellous part he has to play in the future.

So he is to go with us as far as

As far as the centre of the earth, Ael.

Fortyeight hours were left before our departure to my great regret
 had to employ them in preparations for all our ingenuity was
reuired to pack every article to the best advantage instruments
here, arms there, tools in this package, provisions in that: four
sets of packages in all.

The instruments were:

. An Eigel's centigrade thermometer, graduated up to  degrees
 degrees Fahr., which seemed to me too much or too little. Too
much if the internal heat was to rise so high, for in this case we
should be baked, not enough to measure the temperature of springs or
any matter in a state of fusion.

. An aneroid barometer, to indicate etreme pressures of the
atmosphere. An ordinary barometer would not have answered the
purpose, as the pressure would increase during our descent to a point
which the mercurial barometer  would not register.

. A chronometer, made by oissonnas, un., of Geneva, accurately set
to the meridian of amburg.

. Two compasses, vi., a common compass and a dipping needle.

. A night glass.

. Two of uhmkorff's apparatus, which, by means of an electric
current, supplied a safe and handy portable light 

The arms consisted of two of urdy's rifles and two brace of pistols.
ut what did we want arms for? We had neither savages nor wild beasts
to fear,  supposed. ut my uncle seemed to believe in his arsenal as
in his instruments, and more especially in a considerable uantity of
gun cotton, which is unaffected by moisture, and the eplosive force
of which eceeds that of gunpowder.

 n M. erne's book a 'manometer' is the instrument used, of which
very little is known. n a complete list of philosophical instruments
the translator cannot find the name. As he is assured by a firstrate
instrument maker, Chadburn, of iverpool, that an aneroid can be
constructed to measure any depth, he has thought it best to furnish
the adventurous professor with this more familiar instrument. The
'manometer' is generally known as a pressure gauge.TAS.

 uhmkorff's apparatus consists of a unsen pile worked with
bichromate of potash, which makes no smell an induction coil carries
the electricity generated by the pile into communication with a
lantern of peculiar construction in this lantern there is a spiral
glass tube from which the air has been ecluded, and in which remains
only a residuum of carbonic acid gas or of nitrogen. When the
apparatus is put in action this gas becomes luminous, producing a
white steady light. The pile and coil are placed in a leathern bag
which the traveller carries over his shoulders the lantern outside
of the bag throws sufficient light into deep darkness it enables one
to venture without fear of eplosions into the midst of the most
inflammable gases, and is not etinguished even in the deepest
waters. M. uhmkorff is a learned and most ingenious man of science
his great discovery is his induction coil, which produces a powerful
stream of electricity. e obtained in  the uinuennial prie of
, franc reserved by the French government for the most ingenious
application of electricity.

The tools comprised two pickaes, two spades, a silk ropeladder,
three irontipped sticks, a hatchet, a hammer, a doen wedges and
iron spikes, and a long knotted rope. ow this was a large load, for
the ladder was  feet long.

And there were provisions too: this was not a large parcel, but it
was comforting to know that of essence of beef and biscuits there
were si months' consumption. Spirits were the only liuid, and of
water we took none but we had flasks, and my uncle depended on
springs from which to fill them. Whatever obections  haarded as to
their uality, temperature, and even absence, remained ineffectual.

To complete the eact inventory of all our travelling accompaniments,
 must not forget a pocket medicine chest, containing blunt scissors,
splints for broken limbs, a piece of tape of unbleached linen,
bandages and compresses, lint, a lancet for bleeding, all dreadful
articles to take with one. Then there was a row of phials containing
detrine, alcoholic ether, liuid acetate of lead, vinegar, and
ammonia drugs which afforded me no comfort. Finally, all the articles
needful to supply uhmkorff's apparatus.

My uncle did not forget a supply of tobacco, coarse grained powder,
and amadou, nor a leathern belt in which he carried a sufficient
uantity of gold, silver, and paper money. Si pairs of boots and
shoes, made waterproof with a composition of indiarubber and naphtha,
were packed amongst the tools.

Clothed, shod, and euipped like this, said my uncle, there is no
telling how far we may go.

The th was wholly spent in arranging all our different articles. n
the evening we dined with aron Tramps the mayor of ekiavik, and
r. yaltalin, the first medical man of the place, being of the
party. M. Fridrikssen was not there.  learned afterwards that he and
the Governor disagreed upon some uestion of administration, and did
not speak to each other.  therefore knew not a single word of all
that was said at this semiofficial dinner but  could not help
noticing that my uncle talked the whole time.

n the th our preparations were all made. ur host gave the
rofessor very great pleasure by presenting him with a map of celand
far more complete than that of endersen. t was the map of M. laf
ikolas lsen, in the proportion of  to , of the actual sie
of the island, and published by the celandic iterary Society. t
was a precious document for a mineralogist.

ur last evening was spent in intimate conversation with M.
Fridrikssen, with whom  felt the liveliest sympathy then, after the
talk, succeeded, for me, at any rate, a disturbed and restless night.

At five in the morning  was awoke by the neighing and pawing of four
horses under my window.  dressed hastily and came down into the
street. ans was finishing our packing, almost as it were without
moving a limb and yet he did his work cleverly. My uncle made more
noise than eecution, and the guide seemed to pay very little
attention to his energetic directions.

At si o'clock our preparations were over. M. Fridrikssen shook hands
with us. My uncle thanked him heartily for his etreme kindness. 
constructed a few fine atin sentences to epress my cordial
farewell. Then we bestrode our steeds and with his last adieu M.
Fridrikssen treated me to a line of irgil eminently applicable to
such uncertain wanderers as we were likely to be:

Et uacumue viam dedent fortuna seuamur.

Therever fortune clears a way,
Thither our ready footsteps stray.

A AE A


We had started under a sky overcast but calm. There was no fear of
heat, none of disastrous rain. t was ust the weather for tourists.

The pleasure of riding on horseback over an unknown country made me
easy to be pleased at our first start.  threw myself wholly into the
pleasure of the trip, and enoyed the feeling of freedom and
satisfied desire.  was beginning to take a real share in the
enterprise.

esides,  said to myself, where's the risk? ere we are
travelling all through a most interesting country We are about to
climb a very remarkable mountain at the worst we are going to
scramble down an etinct crater. t is evident that Saknussemm did
nothing more than this. As for a passage leading to the centre of the
globe, it is mere rubbish perfectly impossible ery well, then let
us get all the good we can out of this epedition, and don't let us
haggle about the chances.

This reasoning having settled my mind, we got out of ekiavik.

ans moved steadily on, keeping ahead of us at an even, smooth, and
rapid pace. The baggage horses followed him without giving any
trouble. Then came my uncle and myself, looking not so very
illmounted on our small but hardy animals.

celand is one of the largest islands in Europe. ts surface is
, suare miles, and it contains but , inhabitants.
Geographers have divided it into four uarters, and we were crossing
diagonally the southwest uarter, called the 'Sudvester Fordungr.'

n leaving ekiavik ans took us by the seashore. We passed lean
pastures which were trying very hard, but in vain, to look green
yellow came out best. The rugged peaks of the trachyte rocks
presented faint outlines on the eastern horion at times a few
patches of snow, concentrating the vague light, glittered upon the
slopes of the distant mountains certain peaks, boldly uprising,
passed through the grey clouds, and reappeared above the moving
mists, like breakers emerging in the heavens.

ften these chains of barren rocks made a dip towards the sea, and
encroached upon the scanty pasturage: but there was always enough
room to pass. esides, our horses instinctively chose the easiest
places without ever slackening their pace. My uncle was refused even
the satisfaction of stirring up his beast with whip or voice. e had
no ecuse for being impatient.  could not help smiling to see so
tall a man on so small a pony, and as his long legs nearly touched
the ground he looked like a silegged centaur.

Good horse good horse he kept saying. ou will see, Ael, that
there is no more sagacious animal than the celandic horse. e is
stopped by neither snow, nor storm, nor impassable roads, nor rocks,
glaciers, or anything. e is courageous, sober, and surefooted. e
never makes a false step, never shies. f there is a river or fiord
to cross and we shall meet with many you will see him plunge in at
once, ust as if he were amphibious, and gain the opposite bank. ut
we must not hurry him we must let him have his way, and we shall get
on at the rate of thirty miles a day.

We may but how about our guide?

h, never mind him. eople like him get over the ground without a
thought. There is so little action in this man that he will never get
tired and besides, if he wants it, he shall have my horse.  shall
get cramped if  don't have a little action. The arms are all right,
but the legs want eercise.

We were advancing at a rapid pace. The country was already almost a
desert. ere and there was a lonely farm, called a bor built either
of wood, or of sods, or of pieces of lava, looking like a poor beggar
by the wayside. These ruinous huts seemed to solicit charity from
passersby and on very small provocation we should have given alms
for the relief of the poor inmates. n this country there were no
roads and paths, and the poor vegetation, however slow, would soon
efface the rare travellers' footsteps.

et this part of the province, at a very small distance from the
capital, is reckoned among the inhabited and cultivated portions of
celand. What, then, must other tracts be, more desert than this
desert? n the first half mile we had not seen one farmer standing
before his cabin door, nor one shepherd tending a flock less wild
than himself, nothing but a few cows and sheep left to themselves.
What then would be those convulsed regions upon which we were
advancing, regions subect to the dire phenomena of eruptions, the
offspring of volcanic eplosions and subterranean convulsions?

We were to know them before long, but on consulting lsen's map, 
saw that they would be avoided by winding along the seashore. n
fact, the great plutonic action is confined to the central portion of
the island there, rocks of the trappean and volcanic class,
including trachyte, basalt, and tuffs and agglomerates associated
with streams of lava, have made this a land of supernatural horrors.
 had no idea of the spectacle which was awaiting us in the peninsula
of Snfell, where these ruins of a fiery nature have formed a
frightful chaos.

n two hours from ekiavik we arrived at the burgh of Gufunes,
called Aolkirka, or principal church. There was nothing remarkable
here but a few houses, scarcely enough for a German hamlet.

ans stopped here half an hour. e shared with us our frugal
breakfast answering my uncle's uestions about the road and our
resting place that night with merely yes or no, ecept when he said
Gardr.

 consulted the map to see where Gardr was.  saw there was a small
town of that name on the banks of the valfiord, four miles from
ekiavik.  showed it to my uncle.

Four miles only he eclaimed four miles out of twentyeight.
What a nice little walk

e was about to make an observation to the guide, who without
answering resumed his place at the head, and went on his way.

Three hours later, still treading on the colourless grass of the
pasture land, we had to work round the olla fiord, a longer way but
an easier one than across that inlet. We soon entered into a
'pingstaoer' or parish called Eulberg, from whose steeple twelve
o'clock would have struck, if celandic churches were rich enough to
possess clocks. ut they are like the parishioners who have no
watches and do without.

There our horses were baited then taking the narrow path to left
between a chain of hills and the sea, they carried us to our net
stage, the aolkirka of rantr and one mile farther on, to Saurbor
'Anneia,' a chapel of ease built on the south shore of the valfiord.

t was now four o'clock, and we had gone four celandic miles, or
twentyfour English miles.

n that place the fiord was at least three English miles wide the
waves rolled with a rushing din upon the sharppointed rocks this
inlet was confined between walls of rock, precipices crowned by sharp
peaks , feet high, and remarkable for the brown strata which
separated the beds of reddish tuff. owever much  might respect the
intelligence of our uadrupeds,  hardly cared to put it to the test
by trusting myself to it on horseback across an arm of the sea.

f they are as intelligent as they are said to be,  thought, they
won't try it. n any case,  will ta my intelligence to direct
theirs.

ut my uncle would not wait. e spurred on to the edge. is steed
lowered his head to eamine the nearest waves and stopped. My uncle,
who had an instinct of his own, too, applied pressure, and was again
refused by the animal significantly shaking his head. Then followed
strong language, and the whip but the brute answered these arguments
with kicks and endeavours to throw his rider. At last the clever
little pony, with a bend of his knees, started from under the
rofessor's legs, and left him standing upon two boulders on the
shore ust like the colossus of hodes.

Confounded brute cried the unhorsed horseman, suddenly degraded
into a pedestrian, ust as ashamed as a cavalry officer degraded to a
foot soldier.

Fra, said the guide, touching his shoulder.

What a boat?

er, replied ans, pointing to one.

es,  cried there is a boat.

Why did not you say so then? Well, let us go on.

Tidvatten, said the guide.

What is he saying?

e says tide, said my uncle, translating the anish word.

o doubt we must wait for the tide.

Frbida, said my uncle.

a, replied ans.

My uncle stamped with his foot, while the horses went on to the boat.

 perfectly understood the necessity of abiding a particular moment
of the tide to undertake the crossing of the fiord, when, the sea
having reached its greatest height, it should be slack water. Then
the ebb and flow have no sensible effect, and the boat does not risk
being carried either to the bottom or out to sea.

That favourable moment arrived only with si o'clock when my uncle,
myself, the guide, two other passengers and the four horses, trusted
ourselves to a somewhat fragile raft. Accustomed as  was to the
swift and sure steamers on the Elbe,  found the oars of the rowers
rather a slow means of propulsion. t took us more than an hour to
cross the fiord but the passage was effected without any mishap.

n another half hour we had reached the aolkirka of Gardr

t ought to have been nighttime, but under the th parallel there
was nothing surprising in the nocturnal polar light. n celand
during the months of une and uly the sun does not set.

ut the temperature was much lower.  was cold and more hungry than
cold. Welcome was the sight of the bor which was hospitably opened
to receive us.

t was a peasant's house, but in point of hospitality it was eual to
a king's. n our arrival the master came with outstretched hands, and
without more ceremony he beckoned us to follow him.

To accompany him down the long, narrow, dark passage, would have been
impossible. Therefore, we followed, as he bid us. The building was
constructed of roughly suared timbers, with rooms on both sides,
four in number, all opening out into the one passage: these were the
kitchen, the weaving shop, the badstofa, or family sleepingroom, and
the visitors' room, which was the best of all. My uncle, whose height
had not been thought of in building the house, of course hit his head
several times against the beams that proected from the ceilings.

We were introduced into our apartment, a large room with a floor of
earth stamped hard down, and lighted by a window, the panes of which
were formed of sheep's bladder, not admitting too much light. The
sleeping accommodation consisted of dry litter, thrown into two
wooden frames painted red, and ornamented with celandic sentences. 
was hardly epecting so much comfort the only discomfort proceeded
from the strong odour of dried fish, hung meat, and sour milk, of
which my nose made bitter complaints.

When we had laid aside our travelling wraps the voice of the host was
heard inviting us to the kitchen, the only room where a fire was
lighted even in the severest cold.

My uncle lost no time in obeying the friendly call, nor was  slack
in following.

The kitchen chimney was constructed on the ancient pattern in the
middle of the room was a stone for a hearth, over it in the roof a
hole to let the smoke escape. The kitchen was also a diningroom.

At our entrance the host, as if he had never seen us, greeted us with
the word Sllvertu, which means be happy, and came and kissed
us on the cheek.

After him his wife pronounced the same words, accompanied with the
same ceremonial then the two placing their hands upon their hearts,
inclined profoundly before us.

 hasten to inform the reader that this celandic lady was the mother
of nineteen children, all, big and little, swarming in the midst of
the dense wreaths of smoke with which the fire on the hearth filled
the chamber. Every moment  noticed a fairhaired and rather
melancholy face peeping out of the rolling volumes of smokethey
were a perfect cluster of unwashed angels.

My uncle and  treated this little tribe with kindness and in a very
short time we each had three or four of these brats on our shoulders,
as many on our laps, and the rest between our knees. Those who could
speak kept repeating Sllvertu, in every conceivable tone those
that could not speak made up for that want by shrill cries.

This concert was brought to a close by the announcement of dinner. At
that moment our hunter returned, who had been seeing his horses
provided for that is to say, he had economically let them loose in
the fields, where the poor beasts had to content themselves with the
scanty moss they could pull off the rocks and a few meagre sea weeds,
and the net day they would not fail to come of themselves and resume
the labours of the previous day.

Sllvertu, said ans.

Then calmly, automatically, and dispassionately he kissed the host,
the hostess, and their nineteen children.

This ceremony over, we sat at table, twentyfour in number, and
therefore one upon another. The luckiest had only two urchins upon
their knees.

ut silence reigned in all this little world at the arrival of the
soup, and the national taciturnity resumed its empire even over the
children. The host served out to us a soup made of lichen and by no
means unpleasant, then an immense piece of dried fish floating in
butter rancid with twenty years' keeping, and, therefore, according
to celandic gastronomy, much preferable to fresh butter. Along with
this, we had 'skye,' a sort of clotted milk, with biscuits, and a
liuid prepared from uniper berries for beverage we had a thin milk
mied with water, called in this country 'blanda.' t is not for me
to decide whether this diet is wholesome or not all  can say is,
that  was desperately hungry, and that at dessert  swallowed to the
very last gulp of a thick broth made from buckwheat.

As soon as the meal was over the children disappeared, and their
elders gathered round the peat fire, which also burnt such
miscellaneous fuel as briars, cowdung, and fishbones. After this
little pinch of warmth the different groups retired to their
respective rooms. ur hostess hospitably offered us her assistance in
undressing, according to celandic usage but on our gracefully
declining, she insisted no longer, and  was able at last to curl
myself up in my mossy bed.

At five net morning we bade our host farewell, my uncle with
difficulty persuading him to accept a proper remuneration and ans
signalled the start.

At a hundred yards from Gardr the soil began to change its aspect
it became boggy and less favourable to progress. n our right the
chain of mountains was indefinitely prolonged like an immense system
of natural fortifications, of which we were following the
counterscarp or lesser steep often we were met by streams, which we
had to ford with great care, not to wet our packages.

The desert became wider and more hideous yet from time to time we
seemed to descry a human figure that fled at our approach, sometimes
a sharp turn would bring us suddenly within a short distance of one
of these spectres, and  was filled with loathing at the sight of a
huge deformed head, the skin shining and hairless, and repulsive
sores visible through the gaps in the poor creature's wretched rags.

The unhappy being forbore to approach us and offer his misshapen
hand. e fled away, but not before ans had saluted him with the
customary Sllvertu.

Spetelsk, said he.

A leper my uncle repeated.

This word produced a repulsive effect. The horrible disease of
leprosy is too common in celand it is not contagious, but
hereditary, and lepers are forbidden to marry.

These apparitions were not cheerful, and did not throw any charm over
the less and less attractive landscapes. The last tufts of grass had
disappeared from beneath our feet. ot a tree was to be seen, unless
we ecept a few dwarf birches as low as brushwood. ot an animal but
a few wandering ponies that their owners would not feed. Sometimes we
could see a hawk balancing himself on his wings under the grey cloud,
and then darting away south with rapid flight.  felt melancholy
under this savage aspect of nature, and my thoughts went away to the
cheerful scenes  had left in the far south.

We had to cross a few narrow fiords, and at last uite a wide gulf
the tide, then high, allowed us to pass over without delay, and to
reach the hamlet of Alftanes, one mile beyond.

That evening, after having forded two rivers full of trout and pike,
called Alfa and eta, we were obliged to spend the night in a
deserted building worthy to be haunted by all the elfins of
Scandinavia. The ice king certainly held court here, and gave us all
night long samples of what he could do.

o particular event marked the net day. ogs, dead levels,
melancholy desert tracks, wherever we travelled. y nightfall we had
accomplished half our ourney, and we lay at rsolbt.

n the th of une, for about a mile, that is an celandic mile, we
walked upon hardened lava this ground is called in the country
'hraun' the writhen surface presented the appearance of distorted,
twisted cables, sometimes stretched in length, sometimes contorted
together an immense torrent, once liuid, now solid, ran from the
nearest mountains, now etinct volcanoes, but the ruins around
revealed the violence of the past eruptions. et here and there were
a few ets of steam from hot springs.

We had no time to watch these phenomena we had to proceed on our
way. Soon at the foot of the mountains the boggy land reappeared,
intersected by little lakes. ur route now lay westward we had
turned the great bay of Faa, and the twin peaks of Snfell rose
white into the cloudy sky at the distance of at least five miles.

The horses did their duty well, no difficulties stopped them in their
steady career.  was getting tired but my uncle was as firm and
straight as he was at our first start.  could not help admiring his
persistency, as well as the hunter's, who treated our epedition like
a mere promenade.

une . At si p.m. we reached dir, a village on the sea shore
and the guide there claiming his due, my uncle settled with him. t
was ans' own family, that is, his uncles and cousins, who gave us
hospitality we were kindly received, and without taing too much the
goodness of these folks,  would willingly have tarried here to
recruit after my fatigues. ut my uncle, who wanted no recruiting,
would not hear of it, and the net morning we had to bestride our
beasts again.

The soil told of the neighbourhood of the mountain, whose granite
foundations rose from the earth like the knotted roots of some huge
oak. We were rounding the immense base of the volcano. The rofessor
hardly took his eyes off it. e tossed up his arms and seemed to defy
it, and to declare, There stands the giant that  shall conuer.
After about four hours' walking the horses stopped of their own
accord at the door of the priest's house at Stapi.

T ACTCS CA E STAE, T


Stapi is a village consisting of about thirty huts, built of lava, at
the south side of the base of the volcano. t etends along the inner
edge of a small fiord, inclosed between basaltic walls of the
strangest construction.

asalt is a brownish rock of igneous origin. t assumes regular
forms, the arrangement of which is often very surprising. ere nature
had done her work geometrically, with suare and compass and plummet.
Everywhere else her art consists alone in throwing down huge masses
together in disorder. ou see cones imperfectly formed, irregular
pyramids, with a fantastic disarrangement of lines but here, as if
to ehibit an eample of regularity, though in advance of the very
earliest architects, she has created a severely simple order of
architecture, never surpassed either by the splendours of abylon or
the wonders of Greece.

 had heard of the Giant's Causeway in reland, and Fingal's Cave in
Staffa, one of the ebrides but  had never yet seen a basaltic
formation.

At Stapi  beheld this phenomenon in all its beauty.

The wall that confined the fiord, like all the coast of the
peninsula, was composed of a series of vertical columns thirty feet
high. These straight shafts, of fair proportions, supported an
architrave of horiontal slabs, the overhanging portion of which
formed a semiarch over the sea. At intervals, under this natural
shelter, there spread out vaulted entrances in beautiful curves, into
which the waves came dashing with foam and spray. A few shafts of
basalt, torn from their hold by the fury of tempests, lay along the
soil like remains of an ancient temple, in ruins for ever fresh, and
over which centuries passed without leaving a trace of age upon them.

This was our last stage upon the earth. ans had ehibited great
intelligence, and it gave me some little comfort to think then that
he was not going to leave us.

n arriving at the door of the rector's house, which was not
different from the others,  saw a man shoeing a horse, hammer in
hand, and with a leathern apron on.

Sllvertu, said the hunter.

God dag, said the blacksmith in good anish.

yrkoherde, said ans, turning round to my uncle.

The rector, repeated the rofessor. t seems, Ael, that this good
man is the rector.

ur guide in the meanwhile was making the 'kyrkoherde' aware of the
position of things when the latter, suspending his labours for a
moment, uttered a sound no doubt understood between horses and
farriers, and immediately a tall and ugly hag appeared from the hut.
She must have been si feet at the least.  was in great alarm lest
she should treat me to the celandic kiss but there was no occasion
to fear, nor did she do the honours at all too gracefully.

The visitors' room seemed to me the worst in the whole cabin. t was
close, dirty, and evil smelling. ut we had to be content. The rector
did not to go in for antiue hospitality. ery far from it. efore
the day was over  saw that we had to do with a blacksmith, a
fisherman, a hunter, a oiner, but not at all with a minister of the
Gospel. To be sure, it was a weekday perhaps on a Sunday he made
amends.

 don't mean to say anything against these poor priests, who after
all are very wretched. They receive from the anish Government a
ridiculously small pittance, and they get from the parish the fourth
part of the tithe, which does not come to sity marks a year about
. ence the necessity to work for their livelihood but after
fishing, hunting, and shoeing horses for any length of time, one soon
gets into the ways and manners of fishermen, hunters, and farriers,
and other rather rude and uncultivated people and that evening 
found out that temperance was not among the virtues that
distinguished my host.

My uncle soon discovered what sort of a man he had to do with
instead of a good and learned man he found a rude and coarse peasant.
e therefore resolved to commence the grand epedition at once, and
to leave this inhospitable parsonage. e cared nothing about fatigue,
and resolved to spend some days upon the mountain.

The preparations for our departure were therefore made the very day
after our arrival at Stapi. ans hired the services of three
celanders to do the duty of the horses in the transport of the
burdens but as soon as we had arrived at the crater these natives
were to turn back and leave us to our own devices. This was to be
clearly understood.

My uncle now took the opportunity to eplain to ans that it was his
intention to eplore the interior of the volcano to its farthest
limits.

ans merely nodded. There or elsewhere, down in the bowels of the
earth, or anywhere on the surface, all was alike to him. For my own
part the incidents of the ourney had hitherto kept me amused, and
made me forgetful of coming evils but now my fears again were
beginning to get the better of me. ut what could  do? The place to
resist the rofessor would have been amburg, not the foot of Snfell.

ne thought, above all others, harassed and alarmed me it was one
calculated to shake firmer nerves than mine.

ow, thought , here we are, about to climb Snfell. ery good. We
will eplore the crater. ery good, too, others have done as much
without dying for it. ut that is not all. f there is a way to
penetrate into the very bowels of the island, if that illadvised
Saknussemm has told a true tale, we shall lose our way amidst the
deep subterranean passages of this volcano. ow, there is no proof
that Snfell is etinct. Who can assure us that an eruption is not
brewing at this very moment? oes it follow that because the monster
has slept since  he must therefore never awake again? And if he
wakes up presently, where shall we be?

t was worth while debating this uestion, and  did debate it. 
could not sleep for dreaming about eruptions. ow, the part of
eected scoriae and ashes seemed to my mind a very rough one to act.

So, at last, when  could hold out no longer,  resolved to lay the
case before my uncle, as prudently and as cautiously as possible,
ust under the form of an almost impossible hypothesis.

 went to him.  communicated my fears to him, and drew back a step
to give him room for the eplosion which  knew must follow. ut 
was mistaken.

 was thinking of that, he replied with great simplicity.

What could those words mean?Was he actually going to listen to
reason? Was he contemplating the abandonment of his plans? This was
too good to be true.

After a few moments' silence, during which  dared not uestion him,
he resumed:

 was thinking of that. Ever since we arrived at Stapi  have been
occupied with the important uestion you have ust opened, for we
must not be guilty of imprudence.

o, indeed  replied with forcible emphasis.

For si hundred years Snfell has been dumb but he may speak again.
ow, eruptions are always preceded by certain wellknown phenomena. 
have therefore eamined the natives,  have studied eternal
appearances, and  can assure you, Ael, that there will be no
eruption.

At this positive affirmation  stood amaed and speechless.

ou don't doubt my word? said my uncle. Well, follow me.

 obeyed like an automaton. Coming out from the priest's house, the
rofessor took a straight road, which, through an opening in the
basaltic wall, led away from the sea. We were soon in the open
country, if one may give that name to a vast etent of mounds of
volcanic products. This tract seemed crushed under a rain of enormous
eected rocks of trap, basalt, granite, and all kinds of igneous
rocks.

ere and there  could see puffs and ets of steam curling up into
the air, called in celandic 'reykir,' issuing from thermal springs,
and indicating by their motion the volcanic energy underneath. This
seemed to ustify my fears: ut  fell from the height of my newborn
hopes when my uncle said:

ou see all these volumes of steam, Ael well, they demonstrate
that we have nothing to fear from the fury of a volcanic eruption.

Am  to believe that?  cried.

nderstand this clearly, added the rofessor. At the approach of
an eruption these ets would redouble their activity, but disappear
altogether during the period of the eruption. For the elastic fluids,
being no longer under pressure, go off by way of the crater instead
of escaping by their usual passages through the fissures in the soil.
Therefore, if these vapours remain in their usual condition, if they
display no augmentation of force, and if you add to this the
observation that the wind and rain are not ceasing and being replaced
by a still and heavy atmosphere, then you may affirm that no eruption
is preparing.

ut

'o more that is sufficient. When science has uttered her voice, let
babblers hold their peace.'

 returned to the parsonage, very crestfallen. My uncle had beaten me
with the weapons of science. Still  had one hope left, and this was,
that when we had reached the bottom of the crater it would be
impossible, for want of a passage, to go deeper, in spite of all the
Saknussemm's in celand.

 spent that whole night in one constant nightmare in the heart of a
volcano, and from the deepest depths of the earth  saw myself tossed
up amongst the interplanetary spaces under the form of an eruptive
rock.

The net day, une , ans was awaiting us with his companions
carrying provisions, tools, and instruments two iron pointed sticks,
two rifles, and two shot belts were for my uncle and myself. ans, as
a cautious man, had added to our luggage a leathern bottle full of
water, which, with that in our flasks, would ensure us a supply of
water for eight days.

t was nine in the morning. The priest and his tall Megra were
awaiting us at the door. We supposed they were standing there to bid
us a kind farewell. ut the farewell was put in the unepected form
of a heavy bill, in which everything was charged, even to the very
air we breathed in the pastoral house, infected as it was. This
worthy couple were fleecing us ust as a Swiss innkeeper might have
done, and estimated their imperfect hospitality at the highest price.

My uncle paid without a remark: a man who is starting for the centre
of the earth need not be particular about a few ri dollars.

This point being settled, ans gave the signal, and we soon left
Stapi behind us.

SFE AT AST


Snfell is , feet high. ts double cone forms the limit of a
trachytic belt which stands out distinctly in the mountain system of
the island. From our starting point we could see the two peaks boldly
proected against the dark grey sky  could see an enormous cap of
snow coming low down upon the giant's brow.

We walked in single file, headed by the hunter, who ascended by
narrow tracks, where two could not have gone abreast. There was
therefore no room for conversation.

After we had passed the basaltic wall of the fiord of Stapi we passed
over a vegetable fibrous peat bog, left from the ancient vegetation
of this peninsula. The vast uantity of this unworked fuel would be
sufficient to warm the whole population of celand for a century
this vast turbary measured in certain ravines had in many places a
depth of seventy feet, and presented layers of carbonied remains of
vegetation alternating with thinner layers of tufaceous pumice.

As a true nephew of the rofessor iedenbrock, and in spite of my
dismal prospects,  could not help observing with interest the
mineralogical curiosities which lay about me as in a vast museum, and
 constructed for myself a complete geological account of celand.

This most curious island has evidently been proected from the bottom
of the sea at a comparatively recent date. ossibly, it may still be
subect to gradual elevation. f this is the case, its origin may
well be attributed to subterranean fires. Therefore, in this case,
the theory of Sir umphry avy, Saknussemm's document, and my uncle's
theories would all go off in smoke. This hypothesis led me to eamine
with more attention the appearance of the surface, and  soon arrived
at a conclusion as to the nature of the forces which presided at its
birth.

celand, which is entirely devoid of alluvial soil, is wholly
composed of volcanic tufa, that is to say, an agglomeration of porous
rocks and stones. efore the volcanoes broke out it consisted of trap
rocks slowly upraised to the level of the sea by the action of
central forces. The internal fires had not yet forced their way
through.

ut at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from southwest
to northeast, through which was gradually forced out the trachyte
which was to form a mountain chain. o violence accompanied this
change the matter thrown out was in vast uantities, and the liuid
material ooing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in
etensive plains or in hillocky masses. To this period belong the
felspar, syenites, and porphyries.

ut with the help of this outflow the thickness of the crust of the
island increased materially, and therefore also its powers of
resistance. t may easily be conceived what vast uantities of
elastic gases, what masses of molten matter accumulated beneath its
solid surface whilst no eit was practicable after the cooling of the
trachytic crust. Therefore a time would come when the elastic and
eplosive forces of the imprisoned gases would upheave this ponderous
cover and drive out for themselves openings through tall chimneys.
ence then the volcano would distend and lift up the crust, and then
burst through a crater suddenly formed at the summit or thinnest part
of the volcano.

To the eruption succeeded other volcanic phenomena. Through the
outlets now made first escaped the eected basalt of which the plain
we had ust left presented such marvellous specimens. We were moving
over grey rocks of dense and massive formation, which in cooling had
formed into heagonal prisms. Everywhere around us we saw truncated
cones, formerly so many fiery mouths.

After the ehaustion of the basalt, the volcano, the power of which
grew by the etinction of the lesser craters, supplied an egress to
lava, ashes, and scoriae, of which  could see lengthened screes
streaming down the sides of the mountain like flowing hair.

Such was the succession of phenomena which produced celand, all
arising from the action of internal fire and to suppose that the
mass within did not still eist in a state of liuid incandescence
was absurd and nothing could surpass the absurdity of fancying that
it was possible to reach the earth's centre.

So  felt a little comforted as we advanced to the assault of Snfell.

The way was growing more and more arduous, the ascent steeper and
steeper the loose fragments of rock trembled beneath us, and the
utmost care was needed to avoid dangerous falls.

ans went on as uietly as if he were on level ground sometimes he
disappeared altogether behind the huge blocks, then a shrill whistle
would direct us on our way to him. Sometimes he would halt, pick up a
few bits of stone, build them up into a recognisable form, and thus
made landmarks to guide us in our way back. A very wise precaution in
itself, but, as things turned out, uite useless.

Three hours' fatiguing march had only brought us to the base of the
mountain. There ans bid us come to a halt, and a hasty breakfast was
served out. My uncle swallowed two mouthfuls at a time to get on
faster. ut, whether he liked it or not, this was a rest as well as a
breakfast hour and he had to wait till it pleased our guide to move
on, which came to pass in an hour. The three celanders, ust as
taciturn as their comrade the hunter, never spoke, and ate their
breakfasts in silence.

We were now beginning to scale the steep sides of Snfell. ts snowy
summit, by an optical illusion not unfreuent in mountains, seemed
close to us, and yet how many weary hours it took to reach it The
stones, adhering by no soil or fibrous roots of vegetation, rolled
away from under our feet, and rushed down the precipice below with
the swiftness of an avalanche.

At some places the flanks of the mountain formed an angle with the
horion of at least  degrees it was impossible to climb them, and
these stony cliffs had to be tacked round, not without great
difficulty. Then we helped each other with our sticks.

 must admit that my uncle kept as close to me as he could he never
lost sight of me, and in many straits his arm furnished me with a
powerful support. e himself seemed to possess an instinct for
euilibrium, for he never stumbled. The celanders, though burdened
with our loads, climbed with the agility of mountaineers.

To udge by the distant appearance of the summit of Snfell, it would
have seemed too steep to ascend on our side. Fortunately, after an
hour of fatigue and athletic eercises, in the midst of the vast
surface of snow presented by the hollow between the two peaks, a kind
of staircase appeared unepectedly which greatly facilitated our
ascent. t was formed by one of those torrents of stones flung up by
the eruptions, called 'sting' by the celanders. f this torrent had
not been arrested in its fall by the formation of the sides of the
mountain, it would have gone on to the sea and formed more islands.

Such as it was, it did us good service. The steepness increased, but
these stone steps allowed us to rise with facility, and even with
such rapidity that, having rested for a moment while my companions
continued their ascent,  perceived them already reduced by distance
to microscopic dimensions.

At seven we had ascended the two thousand steps of this grand
staircase, and we had attained a bulge in the mountain, a kind of bed
on which rested the cone proper of the crater.

Three thousand two hundred feet below us stretched the sea. We had
passed the limit of perpetual snow, which, on account of the moisture
of the climate, is at a greater elevation in celand than the high
latitude would give reason to suppose. The cold was ecessively keen.
The wind was blowing violently.  was ehausted. The rofessor saw
that my limbs were refusing to perform their office, and in spite of
his impatience he decided on stopping. e therefore spoke to the
hunter, who shook his head, saying:

fvanfr.

t seems we must go higher, said my uncle.

Then he asked ans for his reason.

Mistour, replied the guide.

a Mistour, said one of the celanders in a tone of alarm.

What does that word mean?  asked uneasily.

ook said my uncle.

 looked down upon the plain. An immense column of pulveried pumice,
sand and dust was rising with a whirling circular motion like a
waterspout the wind was lashing it on to that side of Snfell where
we were holding on this dense veil, hung across the sun, threw a
deep shadow over the mountain. f that huge revolving pillar sloped
down, it would involve us in its whirling eddies. This phenomenon,
which is not unfreuent when the wind blows from the glaciers, is
called in celandic 'mistour.'

astigt hastigt cried our guide.

Without knowing anish  understood at once that we must follow ans
at the top of our speed. e began to circle round the cone of the
crater, but in a diagonal direction so as to facilitate our progress.
resently the dust storm fell upon the mountain, which uivered under
the shock the loose stones, caught with the irresistible blasts of
wind, flew about in a perfect hail as in an eruption. appily we were
on the opposite side, and sheltered from all harm. ut for the
precaution of our guide, our mangled bodies, torn and pounded into
fragments, would have been carried afar like the ruins hurled along
by some unknown meteor.

et ans did not think it prudent to spend the night upon the sides
of the cone. We continued our igag climb. The fifteen hundred
remaining feet took us five hours to clear the circuitous route, the
diagonal and the counter marches, must have measured at least three
leagues.  could stand it no longer.  was yielding to the effects of
hunger and cold. The rarefied air scarcely gave play to the action of
my lungs.

At last, at eleven in the sunlight night, the summit of Snfell was
reached, and before going in for shelter into the crater  had time
to observe the midnight sun, at his lowest point, gilding with his
pale rays the island that slept at my feet.

Supper was rapidly devoured, and the little company housed themselves
as best they could. The bed was hard, the shelter not very
substantial, and our position an anious one, at five thousand feet
above the sea level. et  slept particularly well it was one of the
best nights  had ever had, and  did not even dream.

et morning we awoke half froen by the sharp keen air, but with the

 stood on the very summit of the southernmost of Snfell's peaks.
The range of the eye etended over the whole island. y an optical
law which obtains at all great heights, the shores seemed raised and
the centre depressed. t seemed as if one of elbesmer's raised maps
lay at my feet.  could see deep valleys intersecting each other in
every direction, precipices like low walls, lakes reduced to ponds,
rivers abbreviated into streams. n my right were numberless glaciers
and innumerable peaks, some plumed with feathery clouds of smoke. The
undulating surface of these endless mountains, crested with sheets of
snow, reminded one of a stormy sea. f  looked westward, there the
ocean lay spread out in all its magnificence, like a mere
continuation of those flocklike summits. The eye could hardly tell
where the snowy ridges ended and the foaming waves began.

 was thus steeped in the marvellous ecstasy which all high summits
develop in the mind and now without giddiness, for  was beginning
to be accustomed to these sublime aspects of nature. My daled eyes
were bathed in the bright flood of the solar rays.  was forgetting
where and who  was, to live the life of elves and sylphs, the
fanciful creation of Scandinavian superstitions.  felt intoicated
with the sublime pleasure of lofty elevations without thinking of the
profound abysses into which  was shortly to be plunged. ut  was
brought back to the realities of things by the arrival of ans and
the rofessor, who oined me on the summit.

My uncle pointed out to me in the far west a light steam or mist, a
semblance of land, which bounded the distant horion of waters.

Greenland said he.

Greenland?  cried.

es we are only thirtyfive leagues from it and during thaws the
white bears, borne by the ice fields from the north, are carried even
into celand. ut never mind that. ere we are at the top of Snfell
and here are two peaks, one north and one south. ans will tell us
the name of that on which we are now standing.

The uestion being put, ans replied:

Scartaris.

My uncle shot a triumphant glance at me.

ow for the crater he cried.

The crater of Snfell resembled an inverted cone, the opening of which
might be half a league in diameter. ts depth appeared to be about
two thousand feet. magine the aspect of such a reservoir, brim full
and running over with liuid fire amid the rolling thunder. The
bottom of the funnel was about  feet in circuit, so that the
gentle slope allowed its lower brim to be reached without much
difficulty. nvoluntarily  compared the whole crater to an enormous
erected mortar, and the comparison put me in a terrible fright.

What madness,  thought, to go down into a mortar, perhaps a
loaded mortar, to be shot up into the air at a moment's notice

ut  did not try to back out of it. ans with perfect coolness
resumed the lead, and  followed him without a word.

n order to facilitate the descent, ans wound his way down the cone
by a spiral path. ur route lay amidst eruptive rocks, some of which,
shaken out of their loosened beds, rushed bounding down the abyss,
and in their fall awoke echoes remarkable for their loud and
welldefined sharpness.

n certain parts of the cone there were glaciers. ere ans advanced
only with etreme precaution, sounding his way with his ironpointed
pole, to discover any crevasses in it. At particularly dubious
passages we were obliged to connect ourselves with each other by a
long cord, in order that any man who missed his footing might be held
up by his companions. This solid formation was prudent, but did not
remove all danger.

et, notwithstanding the difficulties of the descent, down steeps
unknown to the guide, the ourney was accomplished without accidents,
ecept the loss of a coil of rope, which escaped from the hands of an
celander, and took the shortest way to the bottom of the abyss.

At midday we arrived.  raised my head and saw straight above me the
upper aperture of the cone, framing a bit of sky of very small
circumference, but almost perfectly round. ust upon the edge
appeared the snowy peak of Saris, standing out sharp and clear
against endless space.

At the bottom of the crater were three chimneys, through which, in
its eruptions, Snfell had driven forth fire and lava from its
central furnace. Each of these chimneys was a hundred feet in
diameter. They gaped before us right in our path.  had not the
courage to look down either of them. ut rofessor iedenbrock had
hastily surveyed all three he was panting, running from one to the
other, gesticulating, and uttering incoherent epressions. ans and
his comrades, seated upon loose lava rocks, looked at him with as much
wonder as they knew how to epress, and perhaps taking him for an
escaped lunatic.

Suddenly my uncle uttered a cry.  thought his foot must have slipped
and that he had fallen down one of the holes. ut, no  saw him,
with arms outstretched and legs straddling wide apart, erect before a
granite rock that stood in the centre of the crater, ust like a
pedestal made ready to receive a statue of luto. e stood like a man
stupefied, but the stupefaction soon gave way to delirious rapture.

Ael, Ael, he cried. Come, come

 ran. ans and the celanders never stirred.

ook cried the rofessor.

And, sharing his astonishment, but  think not his oy,  read on the
western face of the block, in unic characters, half mouldered away
with lapse of ages, this thriceaccursed name:

Arne Saknussemm replied my uncle. o you yet doubt?

 made no answer and  returned in silence to my lava seat in a
state of utter speechless consternation. ere was crushing evidence.

ow long  remained plunged in agoniing reflections  cannot tell
all that  know is, that on raising my head again,  saw only my
uncle and ans at the bottom of the crater. The celanders had been
dismissed, and they were now descending the outer slopes of Snfell
to return to Stapi.

ans slept peaceably at the foot of a rock, in a lava bed, where he
had found a suitable couch for himself but my uncle was pacing
around the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage.  had
neither the wish nor the strength to rise, and following the guide's
eample  went off into an unhappy slumber, fancying  could hear
ominous noises or feel tremblings within the recesses of the mountain.

Thus the first night in the crater passed away.

The net morning, a grey, heavy, cloudy sky seemed to droop over the
summit of the cone.  did not know this first from the appearances of
nature, but  found it out by my uncle's impetuous wrath.

 soon found out the cause, and hope dawned again in my heart. For
this reason.

f the three ways open before us, one had been taken by Saknussemm.
The indications of the learned celander hinted at in the cryptogram,
pointed to this fact that the shadow of Scartaris came to touch that
particular way during the latter days of the month of une.

That sharp peak might hence be considered as the gnomon of a vast sun
dial, the shadow proected from which on a certain day would point
out the road to the centre of the earth.

ow, no sun no shadow, and therefore no guide. ere was une . f
the sun was clouded for si days we must postpone our visit till net
year.

My limited powers of description would fail, were  to attempt a
picture of the rofessor's angry impatience. The day wore on, and no
shadow came to lay itself along the bottom of the crater. ans did
not move from the spot he had selected yet he must be asking himself
what were we waiting for, if he asked himself anything at all. My
uncle spoke not a word to me. is gae, ever directed upwards, was
lost in the grey and misty space beyond.

n the th nothing yet. ain mingled with snow was falling all day
long. ans built a hut of pieces of lava.  felt a malicious pleasure
in watching the thousand rills and cascades that came tumbling down
the sides of the cone, and the deafening continuous din awaked by
every stone against which they bounded.

My uncle's rage knew no bounds. t was enough to irritate a meeker
man than he for it was foundering almost within the port.

ut eaven never sends unmied grief, and for rofessor iedenbrock
there was a satisfaction in store proportioned to his desperate
anieties.

The net day the sky was again overcast but on the th of une, the
last day but one of the month, with the change of the moon came a
change of weather. The sun poured a flood of light down the crater.
Every hillock, every rock and stone, every proecting surface, had
its share of the beaming torrent, and threw its shadow on the ground.
Amongst them all, Scartaris laid down his sharppointed angular
shadow which began to move slowly in the opposite direction to that
of the radiant orb.

My uncle turned too, and followed it.

At noon, being at its least etent, it came and softly fell upon the
edge of the middle chimney.

There it is there it is shouted the rofessor.

ow for the centre of the globe he added in anish.

Fort was his tranuil answer.

ow began our real ourney. itherto our toil had overcome all
difficulties, now difficulties would spring up at every step.

 had not yet ventured to look down the bottomless pit into which 
was about to take a plunge. The supreme hour had come.  might now
either share in the enterprise or refuse to move forward. ut  was
ashamed to recoil in the presence of the hunter. ans accepted the
enterprise with such calmness, such indifference, such perfect
disregard of any possible danger that  blushed at the idea of being
less brave than he. f  had been alone  might have once more tried
the effect of argument but in the presence of the guide  held my
peace my heart flew back to my sweet irlandaise, and  approached
the central chimney.

 have already mentioned that it was a hundred feet in diameter, and
three hundred feet round.  bent over a proecting rock and gaed
down. My hair stood on end with terror. The bewildering feeling of
vacuity laid hold upon me.  felt my centre of gravity shifting its
place, and giddiness mounting into my brain like drunkenness. There
is nothing more treacherous than this attraction down deep abysses. 
was ust about to drop down, when a hand laid hold of me. t was that
of ans.  suppose  had not taken as many lessons on gulf
eploration as  ought to have done in the Frelsers irk at
Copenhagen.

ut, however short was my eamination of this well,  had taken some
account of its conformation. ts almost perpendicular walls were
bristling with innumerable proections which would facilitate the
descent. ut if there was no want of steps, still there was no rail.
A rope fastened to the edge of the aperture might have helped us
down. ut how were we to unfasten it, when arrived at the other end?

My uncle employed a very simple epedient to obviate this difficulty.
e uncoiled a cord of the thickness of a finger, and four hundred
feet long first he dropped half of it down, then he passed it round
a lava block that proected conveniently, and threw the other half
down the chimney. Each of us could then descend by holding with the
hand both halves of the rope, which would not be able to unroll
itself from its hold when two hundred feet down, it would be easy to
get possession of the whole of the rope by letting one end go and
pulling down by the other. Then the eercise would go on again ad
infinitum.

ow, said my uncle, after having completed these preparations, now
let us look to our loads.  will divide them into three lots each of
us will strap one upon his back.  mean only fragile articles.

f course, we were not included under that head.

ans, said he, will take charge of the tools and a portion of the
provisions you, Ael, will take another third of the provisions, and
the arms and  will take the rest of the provisions and the delicate
instruments.

ut, said , the clothes, and that mass of ladders and ropes, what
is to become of them?

They will go down by themselves.

ow so?  asked.

ou will see presently.

My uncle was always willing to employ magnificent resources. beying
orders, ans tied all the nonfragile articles in one bundle, corded
them firmly, and sent them bodily down the gulf before us.

 listened to the dull thuds of the descending bale. My uncle,
leaning over the abyss, followed the descent of the luggage with a
satisfied nod, and only rose erect when he had uite lost sight of it.

ery well, now it is our turn.

ow  ask any sensible man if it was possible to hear those words
without a shudder.

The rofessor fastened his package of instruments upon his shoulders
ans took the tools  took the arms: and the descent commenced in
the following order ans, my uncle, and myself. t was effected in
profound silence, broken only by the descent of loosened stones down
the dark gulf.

 dropped as it were, frantically clutching the double cord with one
hand and buttressing myself from the wall with the other by means of
my stick. ne idea overpowered me almost, fear lest the rock should
give way from which  was hanging. This cord seemed a fragile thing
for three persons to be suspended from.  made as little use of it as
possible, performing wonderful feats of euilibrium upon the lava
proections which my foot seemed to catch hold of like a hand.

When one of these slippery steps shook under the heavier form of
ans, he said in his tranuil voice:

Gif akt

Attention repeated my uncle.

n half an hour we were standing upon the surface of a rock ammed in
across the chimney from one side to the other.

ans pulled the rope by one of its ends, the other rose in the air
after passing the higher rock it came down again, bringing with it a
rather dangerous shower of bits of stone and lava.

eaning over the edge of our narrow standing ground,  observed that
the bottom of the hole was still invisible.

The same manoeuvre was repeated with the cord, and half an hour after
we had descended another two hundred feet.

 don't suppose the maddest geologist under such circumstances would
have studied the nature of the rocks that we were passing.  am sure
 did trouble my head about them. liocene, miocene, eocene,
cretaceous, urassic, triassic, permian, carboniferous, devonian,
silurian, or primitive was all one to me. ut the rofessor, no
doubt, was pursuing his observations or taking notes, for in one of
our halts he said to me:

The farther  go the more confidence  feel. The order of these
volcanic formations affords the strongest confirmation to the
theories of avy. We are now among the primitive rocks, upon which
the chemical operations took place which are produced by the contact
of elementary bases of metals with water.  repudiate the notion of
central heat altogether. We shall see further proof of that very
soon.

o variation, always the same conclusion. f course,  was not
inclined to argue. My silence was taken for consent and the descent
went on.

Another three hours, and  saw no bottom to the chimney yet. When 
lifted my head  perceived the gradual contraction of its aperture.
ts walls, by a gentle incline, were drawing closer to each other,
and it was beginning to grow darker.

Still we kept descending. t seemed to me that the falling stones
were meeting with an earlier resistance, and that the concussion gave
a more abrupt and deadened sound.

As  had taken care to keep an eact account of our manoeuvres with
the rope, which  knew that we had repeated fourteen times, each
descent occupying half an hour, the conclusion was easy that we had
been seven hours, plus fourteen uarters of rest, making ten hours
and a half. We had started at one, it must therefore now be eleven
o'clock and the depth to which we had descended was fourteen times
 feet, or , feet.

At this moment  heard the voice of ans.

alt he cried.

 stopped short ust as  was going to place my feet upon my uncle's
head.

We are there, he cried.

Where? said , stepping near to him.

At the bottom of the perpendicular chimney, he answered.

s there no way farther?

es there is a sort of passage which inclines to the right. We will
see about that tomorrow. et us have our supper, and go to sleep.

The darkness was not yet complete. The provision case was opened we
refreshed ourselves, and went to sleep as well as we could upon a bed
of stones and lava fragments.

When lying on my back,  opened my eyes and saw a bright sparkling
point of light at the etremity of the gigantic tube , feet long,
now a vast telescope.

t was a star which, seen from this depth, had lost all
scintillation, and which by my computation should be   rsa
minor. Then  fell fast asleep.

TE WES F TEESTA ETS


At eight in the morning a ray of daylight came to wake us up. The
thousand shining surfaces of lava on the walls received it on its
passage, and scattered it like a shower of sparks.

There was light enough to distinguish surrounding obects.

Well, Ael, what do you say to it? cried my uncle, rubbing his
hands. id you ever spend a uieter night in our little house at
nigsberg? o noise of cart wheels, no cries of basket women, no
boatmen shouting

o doubt it is very uiet at the bottom of this well, but there is
something alarming in the uietness itself.

ow come my uncle cried if you are frightened already, what will
you be by and by? We have not gone a single inch yet into the bowels
of the earth.

What do you mean?

 mean that we have only reached the level of the island, long
vertical tube, which terminates at the mouth of the crater, has its
lower end only at the level of the sea.

Are you sure of that?

uite sure. Consult the barometer.

n fact, the mercury, which had risen in the instrument as fast as we
descended, had stopped at twentynine inches.

ou see, said the rofessor, we have now only the pressure of our
atmosphere, and  shall be glad when the aneroid takes the place of
the barometer.

And in truth this instrument would become useless as soon as the
weight of the atmosphere should eceed the pressure ascertained at
the level of the sea.

ut,  said, is there not reason to fear that this everincreasing
pressure will become at last very painful to bear?

o we shall descend at a slow rate, and our lungs will become
inured to a denser atmosphere. Aeronauts find the want of air as they
rise to high elevations, but we shall perhaps have too much: of the
two, this is what  should prefer. on't let us lose a moment. Where
is the bundle we sent down before us?

 then remembered that we had searched for it in vain the evening
before. My uncle uestioned ans, who, after having eamined
attentively with the eye of a huntsman, replied:

er huppe

p there.

And so it was. The bundle had been caught by a proection a hundred
feet above us. mmediately the celander climbed up like a cat, and
in a few minutes the package was in our possession.

ow, said my uncle, let us breakfast but we must lay in a good
stock, for we don't know how long we may have to go on.

The biscuit and etract of meat were washed down with a draught of
water mingled with a little gin.

reakfast over, my uncle drew from his pocket a small notebook,
intended for scientific observations. e consulted his instruments,
and recorded:

Monday, uly .

Chronometer, . a.m. barometer,  in. thermometer,  
F.. irection, E.S.E.

This last observation applied to the dark gallery, and was indicated
by the compass.

ow, Ael, cried the rofessor with enthusiasm, now we are really
going into the interior of the earth. At this precise moment the
ourney commences.

So saying, my uncle took in one hand uhmkorff's apparatus, which was
hanging from his neck and with the other he formed an electric
communication with the coil in the lantern, and a sufficiently bright
light dispersed the darkness of the passage.

ans carried the other apparatus, which was also put into action.
This ingenious application of electricity would enable us to go on
for a long time by creating an artificial light even in the midst of
the most inflammable gases.

ow, march cried my uncle.

Each shouldered his package. ans drove before him the load of cords
and clothes and, myself walking last, we entered the gallery.

At the moment of becoming engulfed in this dark gallery,  raised my
head, and saw for the last time through the length of that vast tube
the sky of celand, which  was never to behold again.

The lava, in the last eruption of , had forced a passage through
this tunnel. t still lined the walls with a thick and glistening
coat. The electric light was here intensified a hundredfold by
reflection.

The only difficulty in proceeding lay in not sliding too fast down an
incline of about fortyfive degrees happily certain asperities and a
few blisterings here and there formed steps, and we descended,
letting our baggage slip before us from the end of a long rope.

ut that which formed steps under our feet became stalactites
overhead. The lava, which was porous in many places, had formed a
surface covered with small rounded blisters crystals of opaue
uart, set with limpid tears of glass, and hanging like clustered
chandeliers from the vaulted roof, seemed as it were to kindle and
form a sudden illumination as we passed on our way. t seemed as if
the genii of the depths were lighting up their palace to receive
their terrestrial guests.

t is magnificent  cried spontaneously. My uncle, what a sight
on't you admire those blending hues of lava, passing from reddish
brown to bright yellow by imperceptible shades? And these crystals
are ust like globes of light.

Ali, you think so, do you, Ael, my boy? Well, you will see greater
splendours than these,  hope. ow let us march: march

e had better have said slide, for we did nothing but drop down the
steep inclines. t was the facifs descensus Averni of irgil. The
compass, which  consulted freuently, gave our direction as
southeast with infleible steadiness. This lava stream deviated
neither to the right nor to the left.

et there was no sensible increase of temperature. This ustified
avy's theory, and more than once  consulted the thermometer with
surprise. Two hours after our departure it only marked  
Fahr., an increase of only . This gave reason for believing that
our descent was more horiontal than vertical. As for the eact depth
reached, it was very easy to ascertain that the rofessor measured
accurately the angles of deviation and inclination on the road, but
he kept the results to himself.

About eight in the evening he signalled to stop. ans sat down at
once. The lamps were hung upon a proection in the lava we were in a
sort of cavern where there was plenty of air. Certain puffs of air
reached us. What atmospheric disturbance was the cause of them? 
could not answer that uestion at the moment. unger and fatigue made
me incapable of reasoning. A descent of seven hours consecutively is
not made without considerable ependiture of strength.  was
ehausted. The order to 'halt' therefore gave me pleasure. ans laid
our provisions upon a block of lava, and we ate with a good appetite.
ut one thing troubled me, our supply of water was half consumed. My
uncle reckoned upon a fresh supply from subterranean sources, but
hitherto we had met with none.  could not help drawing his attention
to this circumstance.

Are you surprised at this want of springs? he said.

More than that,  am anious about it we have only water enough for
five days.

on't be uneasy, Ael, we shall find more than we want.

When?

When we have left this bed of lava behind us. ow could springs
break through such walls as these?

ut perhaps this passage runs to a very great depth. t seems to me
that we have made no great progress vertically.

Why do you suppose that?

ecause if we had gone deep into the crust of earth, we should have
encountered greater heat.

According to your system, said my uncle. ut what does the
thermometer say?

ardly fifteen degrees  Fahr, nine degrees only since our
departure.

Well, what is your conclusion?

This is my conclusion. According to eact observations, the increase
of temperature in the interior of the globe advances at the rate of
one degree   Fahr. for every hundred feet. ut certain local
conditions may modify this rate. Thus at akoutsk in Siberia the
increase of a degree is ascertained to be reached every  feet. This
difference depends upon the heatconducting power of the rocks.
Moreover, in the neighbourhood of an etinct volcano, through gneiss,
it has been observed that the increase of a degree is only attained
at every  feet. et us therefore assume this last hypothesis as
the most suitable to our situation, and calculate.

Well, do calculate, my boy.

othing is easier, said , putting down figures in my note book.
ine times a hundred and twentyfive feet gives a depth of eleven
hundred and twentyfive feet.

ery accurate indeed.

Well?

y my observation we are at , feet below the level of the sea.

s that possible?

es, or figures are of no use.

The rofessor's calculations were uite correct. We had already
attained a depth of si thousand feet beyond that hitherto reached by
the foot of man, such as the mines of it ahl in Tyrol, and those
of Wuttembourg in ohemia.

The temperature, which ought to have been   Fahr. was
scarcely   Fahr.. ere was cause for reflection.

et day, Tuesday, une , at  a.m., the descent began again.

We were still following the gallery of lava, a real natural
staircase, and as gently sloping as those inclined planes which in
some old houses are still found instead of flights of steps. And so
we went on until ., the, precise moment when we overtook ans,
who had stopped.

Ah here we are, eclaimed my uncle, at the very end of the
chimney.

 looked around me. We were standing at the intersection of two
roads, both dark and narrow. Which were we to take? This was a
difficulty.

Still my uncle refused to admit an appearance of hesitation, either
before me or the guide he pointed out the Eastern tunnel, and we
were soon all three in it.

esides there would have been interminable hesitation before this
choice of roads for since there was no indication whatever to guide
our choice, we were obliged to trust to chance.

The slope of this gallery was scarcely perceptible, and its sections
very uneual. Sometimes we passed a series of arches succeeding each
other like the maestic arcades of a gothic cathedral. ere the
architects of the middle ages might have found studies for every form
of the sacred art which sprang from the development of the pointed
arch. A mile farther we had to bow our heads under corniced elliptic
arches in the romanesue style and massive pillars standing out from
the wall bent under the spring of the vault that rested heavily upon
them. n other places this magnificence gave way to narrow channels
between low structures which looked like beaver's huts, and we had to
creep along through etremely narrow passages.

The heat was perfectly bearable. nvoluntarily  began to think of
its heat when the lava thrown out by Snfell was boiling and working
through this now silent road.  imagined the torrents of fire hurled
back at every angle in the gallery, and the accumulation of intensely
heated vapours in the midst of this confined channel.

 only hope, thought , that this socalled etinct volcano won't
take a fancy in his old age to begin his sports again

 abstained from communicating these fears to rofessor iedenbrock. e
would never have understood them at all. e had but one ideaforward
e walked, he slid, he scrambled, he tumbled, with a persistency which
one could not but admire.

y si in the evening, after a not very fatiguing walk, we had gone
two leagues south, but scarcely a uarter of a mile down.

My uncle said it was time to go to sleep. We ate without talking, and
went to sleep without reflection.

ur arrangements for the night were very simple a railway rug each,
into which we rolled ourselves, was our sole covering. We had neither
cold nor intrusive visits to fear. Travellers who penetrate into the
wilds of central Africa, and into the pathless forests of the ew
World, are obliged to watch over each other by night. ut we enoyed
absolute safety and utter seclusion no savages or wild beasts
infested these silent depths.

et morning, we awoke fresh and in good spirits. The road was
resumed. As the day before, we followed the path of the lava. t was
impossible to tell what rocks we were passing: the tunnel, instead of
tending lower, approached more and more nearly to a horiontal
direction,  even fancied a slight rise. ut about ten this upward
tendency became so evident, and therefore so fatiguing, that  was
obliged to slacken my pace.

Well, Ael? demanded the rofessor impatiently.

Well,  cannot stand it any longer,  replied.

What after three hours' walk over such easy ground.

t may be easy, but it is tiring all the same.

What, when we have nothing to do but keep going down

Going up, if you please.

Going up said my uncle, with a shrug.

o doubt, for the last halfhour the inclines have gone the other
way, and at this rate we shall soon arrive upon the level soil of
celand.

The rofessor nodded slowly and uneasily like a man that declines to
be convinced.  tried to resume the conversation. e answered not a
word, and gave the signal for a start.  saw that his silence was
nothing but illhumour.

Still  had courageously shouldered my burden again, and was rapidly
following ans, whom my uncle preceded.  was anious not to be left
behind. My greatest care was not to lose sight of my companions. 
shuddered at the thought of being lost in the maes of this vast
subterranean labyrinth.

esides, if the ascending road did become steeper,  was comforted
with the thought that it was bringing us nearer to the surface. There
was hope in this. Every step confirmed me in it, and  was reoicing
at the thought of meeting my little Gruben again.

y midday there was a change in the appearance of this wall of the
gallery.  noticed it by a diminution of the amount of light
reflected from the sides solid rock was appearing in the place of
the lava coating. The mass was composed of inclined and sometimes
vertical strata. We were passing through rocks of the transition or
silurian  system.

t is evident,  cried, the marine deposits formed in the second
period, these shales, limestones, and sandstones. We are turning away
from the primary granite. We are ust as if we were people of amburg
going to beck by way of anover

 had better have kept my observations to myself. ut my geological
instinct was stronger than my prudence, and uncle iedenbrock heard
my eclamation.

What's that you are saying? he asked.

See,  said, pointing to the varied series of sandstones and
limestones, and the first indication of slate.

Well?

We are at the period when the first plants and animals appeared.

o you think so?

ook close, and eamine.

 obliged the rofessor to move his lamp over the walls of the
gallery.  epected some signs of astonishment but he spoke not a
word, and went on.

ad he understood me or not? id he refuse to admit, out of selflove
as an uncle and a philosopher, that he had mistaken his way when he
chose the eastern tunnel? or was he determined to eamine this
passage to its farthest etremity? t was evident that we had left
the lava path, and that this road could not possibly lead to the
etinct furnace of Snfell.

et  asked myself if  was not depending too much on this change in
the rock. Might  not myself be mistaken? Were we really crossing the
layers of rock which overlie the granite foundation?

The name given by Sir oderick Murchison to a vast series of
fossiliferous strata, which lies between the nonfossiliferous slaty
schists below and the old red sandstone above. The system is well
developed in the region of Shropshire, etc., once inhabited by the
Silures under Caractacus, or Caradoc. Tr.

primitive life and then we must yield to evidence.  will look.

 had not gone a hundred paces before incontestable proofs presented
themselves. t could not be otherwise, for in the Silurian age the
seas contained at least fifteen hundred vegetable and animal species.
My feet, which had become accustomed to the indurated lava floor,
suddenly rested upon a dust composed of the debris of plants and
shells. n the walls were distinct impressions of fucoids and
lycopodites.

rofessor iedenbrock could not be mistaken,  thought, and yet he
pushed on, with,  suppose, his eyes resolutely shut.

This was only invincible obstinacy.  could hold out no longer.

your determination, if there were not a danger threatening us nearer
and nearer.

What danger?

The want of water.

Well, Ael, we will put ourselves upon rations.

n fact, we had to ration ourselves. ur provision of water could not
last more than three days.  found that out for certain when
suppertime came. And, to our sorrow, we had little reason to epect
to find a spring in these transition beds.

The whole of the net day the gallery opened before us its endless
arcades. We moved on almost without a word. ans' silence seemed to
be infecting us.

The road was now not ascending, at least not perceptibly. Sometimes,
even, it seemed to have a slight fall. ut this tendency, which was
very trifling, could not do anything to reassure the rofessor for
there was no change in the beds, and the transitional characteristics
became more and more decided.

The electric light was reflected in sparkling splendour from the
schist, limestone, and old red sandstone of the walls. t might have
been thought that we were passing through a section of Wales, of
which an ancient people gave its name to this system. Specimens of
magnificent marbles clothed the walls, some of a greyish agate
fantastically veined with white, others of rich crimson or yellow
dashed with splotches of red then came dark cherrycoloured marbles
relieved by the lighter tints of limestone.

The greater part of these bore impressions of primitive organisms.
Creation had evidently advanced since the day before. nstead of
rudimentary trilobites,  noticed remains of a more perfect order of
beings, amongst others ganoid fishes and some of those sauroids in
which palaeontologists have discovered the earliest reptile forms.
The evonian seas were peopled by animals of these species, and
deposited them by thousands in the rocks of the newer formation.

t was evident that we were ascending that scale of animal life in
which man fills the highest place. ut rofessor iedenbrock seemed
not to notice it.

e was awaiting one of two events, either the appearance of a
vertical well opening before his feet, down which our descent might
be resumed, or that of some obstacle which should effectually turn us
back on our own footsteps. ut evening came and neither wish was
gratified.

n Friday, after a night during which  felt pangs of thirst, our
little troop again plunged into the winding passages of the gallery.

After ten hours' walking  observed a singular deadening of the
reflection of our lamps from the side walls. The marble, the schist,
the limestone, and the sandstone were giving way to a dark and
lustreless lining. At one moment, the tunnel becoming very narrow, 
leaned against the wall.

When  removed my hand it was black.  looked nearer, and found we
were in a coal formation.

A coal mine  cried.

A mine without miners, my uncle replied.

Who knows?  asked.

 know, the rofessor pronounced decidedly,  am certain that this
gallery driven through beds of coal was never pierced by the hand of
man. ut whether it be the hand of nature or not does not matter.
Supper time is come let us sup.

ans prepared some food.  scarcely ate, and  swallowed down the few
drops of water rationed out to me. ne flask half full was all we had
left to slake the thirst of three men.

After their meal my two companions laid themselves down upon their
rugs, and found in sleep a solace for their fatigue. ut  could not
sleep, and  counted every hour until morning.

n Saturday, at si, we started afresh. n twenty minutes we reached
a vast open space  then knew that the hand of man had not hollowed
out this mine the vaults would have been shored up, and, as it was,
they seemed to be held up by a miracle of euilibrium.

This cavern was about a hundred feet wide and a hundred and fifty in
height. A large mass had been rent asunder by a subterranean
disturbance. ielding to some vast power from below it had broken
asunder, leaving this great hollow into which human beings were now
penetrating for the first time.

The whole history of the carboniferous period was written upon these
gloomy walls, and a geologist might with ease trace all its diverse
phases. The beds of coal were separated by strata of sandstone or
compact clays, and appeared crushed under the weight of overlying
strata.

At the age of the world which preceded the secondary period, the
earth was clothed with immense vegetable forms, the product of the
double influence of tropical heat and constant moisture a vapoury
atmosphere surrounded the earth, still veiling the direct rays of the
sun.

Thence arises the conclusion that the high temperature then eisting
was due to some other source than the heat of the sun. erhaps even
the orb of day may not have been ready yet to play the splendid part
he now acts. There were no 'climates' as yet, and a torrid heat,
eual from pole to euator, was spread over the whole surface of the
globe. Whence this heat? Was it from the interior of the earth?

otwithstanding the theories of rofessor iedenbrock, a violent heat
did at that time brood within the body of the spheroid. ts action
was felt to the very last coats of the terrestrial crust the plants,
unacuainted with the beneficent influences of the sun, yielded
neither flowers nor scent. ut their roots drew vigorous life from
the burning soil of the early days of this planet.

There were but few trees. erbaceous plants alone eisted. There were
tall grasses, ferns, lycopods, besides sigillaria, asterophyllites,
now scarce plants, but then the species might be counted by thousands.

The coal measures owe their origin to this period of profuse
vegetation. The yet elastic and yielding crust of the earth obeyed
the fluid forces beneath. Thence innumerable fissures and
depressions. The plants, sunk underneath the waters, formed by
degrees into vast accumulated masses.

Then came the chemical action of nature in the depths of the seas
the vegetable accumulations first became peat then, acted upon by
generated gases and the heat of fermentation, they underwent a
process of complete mineraliation.

Thus were formed those immense coalfields, which nevertheless, are
not inehaustible, and which three centuries at the present
accelerated rate of consumption will ehaust unless the industrial
world will devise a remedy.

These reflections came into my mind whilst  was contemplating the
mineral wealth stored up in this portion of the globe. These no
doubt,  thought, will never be discovered the working of such deep
mines would involve too large an outlay, and where would be the use
as long as coal is yet spread far and wide near the surface? Such as
my eyes behold these virgin stores, such they will be when this world
comes to an end.

ut still we marched on, and  alone was forgetting the length of the
way by losing myself in the midst of geological contemplations. The
temperature remained what it had been during our passage through the
lava and schists. nly my sense of smell was forcibly affected by an
odour of protocarburet of hydrogen.  immediately recognised in this
gallery the presence of a considerable uantity of the dangerous gas
called by miners firedamp, the eplosion of which has often
occasioned such dreadful catastrophes.

appily, our light was from uhmkorff's ingenious apparatus. f
unfortunately we had eplored this gallery with torches, a terrible
eplosion would have put an end to travelling and travellers at one
stroke.

This ecursion through the coal mine lasted till night. My uncle
scarcely could restrain his impatience at the horiontal road. The
darkness, always deep twenty yards before us, prevented us from
estimating the length of the gallery and  was beginning to think it
must be endless, when suddenly at si o'clock a wall very
unepectedly stood before us. ight or left, top or bottom, there was
no road farther we were at the end of a blind alley. ery well,
it's all right cried my uncle, now, at any rate, we shall know
what we are about. We are not in Saknussemm's road, and all we have
to do is to go back. et us take a night's rest, and in three days we
shall get to the fork in the road. es, said , if we have any
strength left. Why not? ecause tomorrow we shall have no
water. or courage either? asked my uncle severely.  dared make
no answer.

et day we started early. We had to hasten forward. t was a three
days' march to the cross roads.

 will not speak of the sufferings we endured in our return. My uncle
bore them with the angry impatience of a man obliged to own his
weakness ans with the resignation of his passive nature , 
confess, with complaints and epressions of despair.  had no spirit
to oppose this ill fortune.

As  had foretold, the water failed entirely by the end of the first
day's retrograde march. ur fluid aliment was now nothing but gin
but this infernal fluid burned my throat, and  could not even endure
the sight of it.  found the temperature and the air stifling.
Fatigue paralysed my limbs. More than once  dropped down motionless.
Then there was a halt and my uncle and the celander did their best
to restore me. ut  saw that the former was struggling painfully
against ecessive fatigue and the tortures of thirst.

At last, on Tuesday, uly , we arrived on our hands and knees, and
half dead, at the unction of the two roads. There  dropped like a
lifeless lump, etended on the lava soil. t was ten in the morning.

of biscuit. ong moans escaped from my swollen lips.

amaement he placed it on my lips.

stupidly, and felt as if  could not understand him.

And raising his flask he emptied it every drop between my lips.

burning mouth. t was but one sip but it was enough to recall my
ebbing life.

 thanked my uncle with clasped hands.

es, he said, a draught of water but it is the very lastyou
hearthe last.  had kept it as a precious treasure at the bottom
of my flask. Twenty times, nay, a hundred times, have  fought
against a frightful impulse to drink it off. ut no, Ael,  kept it
for you.

My dear uncle,  said, whilst hot tears trickled down my face.

es, my poor boy,  knew that as soon as you arrived at these cross
roads you would drop half dead, and  kept my last drop of water to
reanimate you.

Thank you, thank you,  said. Although my thirst was only partially
uenched, yet some strength had returned. The muscles of my throat,
until then contracted, now relaed again and the inflammation of my
lips abated somewhat and  was now able to speak. .

et us see,  said, we have now but one thing to do. We have no
water we must go back.

While  spoke my uncle avoided looking at me he hung his head down
his eyes avoided mine.

We must return,  eclaimed vehemently we must go back on our way
to Snfell. May God give us strength to climb up the crater again

eturn said my uncle, as if he was rather answering himself than
me.

es, return, without the loss of a minute.

A long silence followed.

So then, Ael, replied the rofessor ironically, you have found no
courage or energy in these few drops of water?

Courage?

 see you ust as feebleminded as you were before, and still
epressing only despair

What sort of a man was this  had to do with, and what schemes was he
now revolving in his fearless mind?

What you won't go back?

Should  renounce this epedition ust when we have the fairest
chance of success ever

Then must we resign ourselves to destruction?

o, Ael, no go back. ans will go with you. eave me to myself

eave you here

carry it out to the end, and  will not return. Go, Ael, go

My uncle was in high state of ecitement. is voice, which had for a
moment been tender and gentle, had now become hard and threatening.
e was struggling with gloomy resolutions against impossibilities. 
would not leave him in this bottomless abyss, and on the other hand
the instinct of selfpreservation prompted me to fly.

The guide watched this scene with his usual phlegmatic unconcern. et
he understood perfectly well what was going on between his two
companions. The gestures themselves were sufficient to show that we
were each bent on taking a different road but ans seemed to take no
part in a uestion upon which depended his life. e was ready to
start at a given signal, or to stay, if his master so willed it.

ow  wished at this moment  could have made him understand me. My
words, my complaints, my sorrow would have had some influence over
that frigid nature. Those dangers which our guide could not
understand  could have demonstrated and proved to him. Together we

might perhaps have compelled him to regain the heights of Snfell.

My parted lips sufficiently revealed my sufferings. The celander
slowly moved his head, and calmly pointing to my uncle said:

life we must fly, we must drag him. o you hear me? o you

Therefore, listen to my proposal.

 crossed my arms, and confronted my uncle boldly.

The want of water, he said, is the only obstacle in our way. n
this eastern gallery made up of lavas, schists, and coal, we have not
met with a single particle of moisture. erhaps we shall be more
fortunate if we follow the western tunnel.

 shook my head incredulously.

ear me to the end, the rofessor went on with a firm voice.
Whilst you were lying there motionless,  went to eamine the
conformation of that gallery. t penetrates directly downward, and in
a few hours it will bring us to the granite rocks. There we must meet
with abundant springs. The nature of the rock assures me of this, and
instinct agrees with logic to support my conviction. ow, this is my
proposal. When Columbus asked of his ships' crews for three days more
to discover a new world, those crews, disheartened and sick as they
were, recognised the ustice of the claim, and he discovered America.
 am the Columbus of this nether world, and  only ask for one more
day. f in a single day  have not met with the water that we want, 
swear to you we will return to the surface of the earth.

with the violence my uncle was doing to his own wishes in making so
haardous a proposal.

Well,  said, do as you will, and God reward your superhuman
energy. ou have now but a few hours to tempt fortune. et us start

This time the descent commenced by the new gallery. ans walked first
as was his custom.

We had not gone a hundred yards when the rofessor, moving his
lantern along the walls, cried:

ere are primitive rocks. ow we are in the right way. Forward

When in its early stages the earth was slowly cooling, its
contraction gave rise in its crust to disruptions, distortions,
fissures, and chasms. The passage through which we were moving was
such a fissure, through which at one time granite poured out in a
molten state. ts thousands of windings formed an inetricable
labyrinth through the primeval mass.

As fast as we descended, the succession of beds forming the primitive
foundation came out with increasing distinctness. Geologists consider
this primitive matter to be the base of the mineral crust of the
earth, and have ascertained it to be composed of three different
formations, schist, gneiss, and mica schist, resting upon that
unchangeable foundation, the granite.

ever had mineralogists found themselves in so marvellous a situation
to study nature in situ. What the boring machine, an insensible,
inert instrument, was unable to bring to the surface of the inner
structure of the globe, we were able to peruse with our own eyes and
handle with our own hands.

Through the beds of schist, coloured with delicate shades of green,
ran in winding course threads of copper and manganese, with traces of
platinum and gold.  thought, what riches are here buried at an
unapproachable depth in the earth, hidden for ever from the covetous
eyes of the human race These treasures have been buried at such a
profound depth by the convulsions of primeval times that they run no
chance of ever being molested by the pickae or the spade.

To the schists succeeded gneiss, partially stratified, remarkable for
the parallelism and regularity of its lamina, then mica schists, laid
in large plates or flakes, revealing their lamellated structure by
the sparkle of the white shining mica.

The light from our apparatus, reflected from the small facets of
uart, shot sparkling rays at every angle, and  seemed to be moving
through a diamond, within which the uickly darting rays broke across
each other in a thousand flashing coruscations.

About si o'clock this brilliant fete of illuminations underwent a
sensible abatement of splendour, then almost ceased. The walls
assumed a crystallised though sombre appearance mica was more
closely mingled with the feldspar and uart to form the proper rocky
foundations of the earth, which bears without distortion or crushing
the weight of the four terrestrial systems. We were immured within
prison walls of granite.

t was eight in the evening. o signs of water had yet appeared. 
was suffering horribly. My uncle strode on. e refused to stop. e
was listening aniously for the murmur of distant springs. ut, no,
there was dead silence.

And now my limbs were failing beneath me.  resisted pain and
torture, that  might not stop my uncle, which would have driven him
to despair, for the day was drawing near to its end, and it was his
last.

At last  failed utterly  uttered a cry and fell.

Come to me,  am dying.

My uncle retraced his steps. e gaed upon me with his arms crossed
then these muttered words passed his lips:

t's all over

The last thing  saw was a fearful gesture of rage, and my eyes
closed.

When  reopened them  saw my two companions motionless and rolled up
in their coverings. Were they asleep? As for me,  could not get one
moment's sleep.  was suffering too keenly, and what embittered my
thoughts was that there was no remedy. My uncle's last words echoed
painfully in my ears: it's all over For in such a fearful state of
debility it was madness to think of ever reaching the upper world
again.

We had above us a league and a half of terrestrial crust. The weight
of it seemed to be crushing down upon my shoulders.  felt weighed
down, and  ehausted myself with imaginary violent eertions to turn
round upon my granite couch.

A few hours passed away. A deep silence reigned around us, the
silence of the grave. o sound could reach us through walls, the
thinnest of which were five miles thick.

et in the midst of my stupefaction  seemed to be aware of a noise.
t was dark down the tunnel, but  seemed to see the celander
vanishing from our sight with the lamp in his hand.

Why was he leaving us? Was ans going to forsake us? My uncle was
fast asleep.  wanted to shout, but my voice died upon my parched and
swollen lips. The darkness became deeper, and the last sound died
away in the far distance.

ans has abandoned us,  cried. ans ans

ut these words were only spoken within me. They went no farther. et
after the first moment of terror  felt ashamed of suspecting a man
of such etraordinary faithfulness. nstead of ascending he was
descending the gallery. An evil design would have taken him up not
down. This reflection restored me to calmness, and  turned to other
thoughts. one but some weighty motive could have induced so uiet a
man to forfeit his sleep. Was he on a ourney of discovery? ad he
during the silence of the night caught a sound, a murmuring of
something in the distance, which had failed to affect my hearing?

For a whole hour  was trying to work out in my delirious brain the
reasons which might have influenced this seemingly tranuil huntsman.
The absurdest notions ran in utter confusion through my mind. 
thought madness was coming on

ut at last a noise of footsteps was heard in the dark abyss. ans
was approaching. A flickering light was beginning to glimmer on the
wall of our darksome prison then it came out full at the mouth of
the gallery. ans appeared.

e drew close to my uncle, laid his hand upon his shoulder, and
gently woke him. My uncle rose up.

What is the matter? he asked.

Watten replied the huntsman.

o doubt under the inspiration of intense pain everybody becomes
endowed with the gift of divers tongues.  did not know a word of
anish, yet instinctively  understood the word he had uttered.

Water water  cried, clapping my hands and gesticulating like a
madman.

Water repeated my uncle. var? he asked, in celandic.

edat, replied ans.

Where? own below  understood it all.  seied the hunter's
hands, and pressed them while he looked on me without moving a muscle
of his countenance.

The preparations for our departure were not long in making, and we
were soon on our way down a passage inclining two feet in seven. n
an hour we had gone a mile and a uarter, and descended two thousand
feet.

Then  began to hear distinctly uite a new sound of something
running within the thickness of the granite wall, a kind of dull,
dead rumbling, like distant thunder. uring the first part of our
walk, not meeting with the promised spring,  felt my agony
returning but then my uncle acuainted me with the cause of the
strange noise.

ans was not mistaken, he said. What you hear is the rushing of a
torrent.

A torrent?  eclaimed.

There can be no doubt a subterranean river is flowing around us.

We hurried forward in the greatest ecitement.  was no longer
sensible of my fatigue. This murmuring of waters close at hand was
already refreshing me. t was audibly increasing. The torrent, after
having for some time flowed over our heads, was now running within
the left wall, roaring and rushing. Freuently  touched the wall,
hoping to feel some indications of moisture: ut there was no hope
here.

et another half hour, another half league was passed.

Then it became clear that the hunter had gone no farther. Guided by
an instinct peculiar to mountaineers he had as it were felt this
torrent through the rock but he had certainly seen none of the
precious liuid he had drunk nothing himself.

Soon it became evident that if we continued our walk we should widen
the distance between ourselves and the stream, the noise of which was
becoming fainter.

We returned. ans stopped where the torrent seemed closest.  sat
near the wall, while the waters were flowing past me at a distance of
two feet with etreme violence. ut there was a thick granite wall
between us and the obect of our desires.

Without reflection, without asking if there were any means of
procuring the water,  gave way to a movement of despair.

ans glanced at me with,  thought, a smile of compassion.

e rose and took the lamp.  followed him. e moved towards the wall.
 looked on. e applied his ear against the dry stone, and moved it
slowly to and fro, listening intently.  perceived at once that he
was eamining to find the eact place where the torrent could be
heard the loudest. e met with that point on the left side of the
tunnel, at three feet from the ground.

 was stirred up with ecitement.  hardly dared guess what the
hunter was about to do. ut  could not but understand, and applaud
and cheer him on, when  saw him lay hold of the pickae to make an
attack upon the rock.

We are saved  cried.

es, cried my uncle, almost frantic with ecitement. ans is
right. Capital fellow Who but he would have thought of it?

es who but he? Such an epedient, however simple, would never have
entered into our minds. True, it seemed most haardous to strike a
blow of the hammer in this part of the earth's structure. Suppose
some displacement should occur and crush us all Suppose the torrent,
bursting through, should drown us in a sudden flood There was
nothing vain in these fancies. ut still no fears of falling rocks or
rushing floods could stay us now and our thirst was so intense that,
to satisfy it, we would have dared the waves of the north Atlantic.

ans set about the task which my uncle and  together could not have
accomplished. f our impatience had armed our hands with power, we
should have shattered the rock into a thousand fragments. ot so
ans. Full of self possession, he calmly wore his way through the
rock with a steady succession of light and skilful strokes, working
through an aperture si inches wide at the outside.  could hear a
louder noise of flowing waters, and  fancied  could feel the
delicious fluid refreshing my parched lips.

The pick had soon penetrated two feet into the granite partition, and
our man had worked for above an hour.  was in an agony of
impatience. My uncle wanted to employ stronger measures, and  had
some difficulty in dissuading him still he had ust taken a pickae
in his hand, when a sudden hissing was heard, and a et of water
spurted out with violence against the opposite wall.

ans, almost thrown off his feet by the violence of the shock,
uttered a cry of grief and disappointment, of which  soon under.
stood the cause, when plunging my hands into the spouting torrent, 
withdrew them in haste, for the water was scalding hot.

The water is at the boiling point,  cried.

Well, never mind, let it cool, my uncle replied.

The tunnel was filling with steam, whilst a stream was forming, which
by degrees wandered away into subterranean windings, and soon we had
the satisfaction of swallowing our first draught.

Could anything be more delicious than the sensation that our burning
intolerable thirst was passing away, and leaving us to enoy comfort
and pleasure? ut where was this water from? o matter. t was water
and though still warm, it brought life back to the dying.  kept
drinking without stopping, and almost without tasting.

At last after a most delightful time of reviving energy,  cried,
Why, this is a chalybeate spring

othing could be better for the digestion, said my uncle. t is
highly impregnated with iron. t will be as good for us as going to
the Spa, or to Tplit.

Well, it is delicious

f course it is, water should be, found si miles underground. t
has an inky flavour, which is not at all unpleasant. What a capital
source of strength ans has found for us here. We will call it after
his name.

Agreed,  cried.

And ansbach it was from that moment.

ans was none the prouder. After a moderate draught, he went uietly
into a corner to rest.

ow,  said, we must not lose this water.

What is the use of troubling ourselves? my uncle, replied.  fancy
it will never fail.

ever mind, we cannot be sure let us fill the water bottle and our
flasks, and then stop up the opening.

My advice was followed so far as getting in a supply but the
stopping up of the hole was not so easy to accomplish. t was in vain
that we took up fragments of granite, and stuffed them in with tow,
we only scalded our hands without succeeding. The pressure was too
great, and our efforts were fruitless.

t is uite plain, said , that the higher body of this water is
at a considerable elevation. The force of the et shows that.

o doubt, answered my uncle. f this column of water is ,
feet highthat is, from the surface of the earth, it is eual to
the weight of a thousand atmospheres. ut  have got an idea.

Well?

Why should we trouble ourselves to stop the stream from coming out
at all?

ecause Well,  could not assign a reason.

When our flasks are empty, where shall we fill them again? Can we
tell that?

o there was no certainty.

Well, let us allow the water to run on. t will flow down, and will
both guide and refresh us.

That is well planned,  cried. With this stream for our guide,
there is no reason why we should not succeed in our undertaking.

Ah, my boy you agree with me now, cried the rofessor, laughing.

 agree with you most heartily.

Well, let us rest awhile and then we will start again.

y the net day we had forgotten all our sufferings. At first,  was
wondering that  was no longer thirsty, and  was for asking for the
reason. The answer came in the murmuring of the stream at my feet.

We breakfasted, and drank of this ecellent chalybeate water.  felt
wonderfully stronger, and uite decided upon pushing on. Why should
not so firmly convinced a man as my uncle, furnished with so
industrious a guide as ans, and accompanied by so determined a
nephew as myself, go on to final success? Such were the magnificent
plans which struggled for mastery within me. f it had been proposed
to me to return to the summit of Snfell,  should have indignantly
declined.

Most fortunately, all we had to do was to descend.

et us start  cried, awakening by my shouts the echoes of the
vaulted hollows of the earth.

n Thursday, at  a.m., we started afresh. The granite tunnel winding
from side to side, earned us past unepected turns, and seemed almost
to form a labyrinth but, on the whole, its direction seemed to be
southeasterly. My uncle never ceased to consult his compass, to keep
account of the ground gone over.

The gallery dipped down a very little way from the horiontal,
scarcely more than two inches in a fathom, and the stream ran gently
murmuring at our feet.  compared it to a friendly genius guiding us
underground, and caressed with my hand the soft naiad, whose
comforting voice accompanied our steps. With my reviving spirits
these mythological notions seemed to come unbidden.

As for my uncle, he was beginning to storm against the horiontal
road. e loved nothing better than a vertical path but this way
seemed indefinitely prolonged, and instead of sliding along the
hypothenuse as we were now doing, he would willingly have dropped
down the terrestrial radius. ut there was no help for it, and as
long as we were approaching the centre at all we felt that we must
not complain.

From time to time, a steeper path appeared our naiad then began to
tumble before us with a hoarser murmur, and we went down with her to
a greater depth.

n the whole, that day and the net we made considerable way
horiontally, very little vertically.

n Friday evening, the th of uly, according to our calculations,
we were thirty leagues southeast of ekiavik, and at a depth of two
leagues and a half.

At our feet there now opened a frightful abyss. My uncle, however,
was not to be daunted, and he clapped his hands at the steepness of
the descent.

This will take us a long way, he cried, and without much
difficulty for the proections in the rock form uite a staircase.

The ropes were so fastened by ans as to guard against accident, and
the descent commenced.  can hardly call it perilous, for  was
beginning to be familiar with this kind of eercise.

This well, or abyss, was a narrow cleft in the mass of the granite,
called by geologists a 'fault,' and caused by the uneual cooling of
the globe of the earth. f it had at one time been a passage for
eruptive matter thrown out by Snfell,  still could not understand
why no trace was left of its passage. We kept going down a kind of
winding staircase, which seemed almost to have been made by the hand
of man.

Every uarter of an hour we were obliged to halt, to take a little
necessary repose and restore the action of our limbs. We then sat
down upon a fragment of rock, and we talked as we ate and drank from
the stream.

f course, down this fault the ansbach fell in a cascade, and lost
some of its volume but there was enough and to spare to slake our
thirst. esides, when the incline became more gentle, it would of
course resume its peaceable course. At this moment it reminded me of
my worthy uncle, in his freuent fits of impatience and anger, while
below it ran with the calmness of the celandic hunter.

n the th and th of uly we kept following the spiral curves of
this singular well, penetrating in actual distance no more than two
leagues but being carried to a depth of five leagues below the level
of the sea. ut on the th, about noon, the fault took, towards the
southeast, a much gentler slope, one of about fortyfive degrees.

Then the road became monotonously easy. t could not be otherwise,
for there was no landscape to vary the stages of our ourney.

n Wednesday, the th, we were seven leagues underground, and had
travelled fifty leagues away from Snfell. Although we were tired,
our health was perfect, and the medicine chest had not yet had
occasion to be opened.

My uncle noted every hour the indications of the compass, the
chronometer, the aneroid, and the thermometer the very same which he
has published in his scientific report of our ourney. t was
therefore not difficult to know eactly our whereabouts. When he told
me that we had gone fifty leagues horiontally,  could not repress
an eclamation of astonishment, at the thought that we had now long
left celand behind us.

What is the matter? he cried.

 was reflecting that if your calculations are correct we are no
longer under celand.

o you think so?

 am not mistaken,  said, and eamining the map,  added, We have
passed Cape ortland, and those fifty leagues bring us under the wide
epanse of ocean.

nder the sea, my uncle repeated, rubbing his hands with delight.

Can it be?  said. s the ocean spread above our heads?

f course, Ael. What can be more natural? At ewcastle are there
not coal mines etending far under the sea?

t was all very well for the rofessor to call this so simple, but 
could not feel uite easy at the thought that the boundless ocean was
rolling over my head. And yet it really mattered very little whether
it was the plains and mountains that covered our heads, or the
Atlantic waves, as long as we were arched over by solid granite. And,
besides,  was getting used to this idea for the tunnel, now running
straight, now winding as capriciously in its inclines as in its
turnings, but constantly preserving its southeasterly direction, and
always running deeper, was gradually carrying us to very great depths
indeed.

Four days later, Saturday, the th of uly, in the evening, we
arrived at a kind of vast grotto and here my uncle paid ans his
weekly wages, and it was settled that the net day, Sunday, should be
a day of rest.

 therefore awoke net day relieved from the preoccupation of an
immediate start. Although we were in the very deepest of known
depths, there was something not unpleasant about it. And, besides, we
were beginning to get accustomed to this troglodyte  life.  no
longer thought of sun, moon, and stars, trees, houses, and towns, nor
of any of those terrestrial superfluities which are necessaries of
men who live upon the earth's surface. eing fossils, we looked upon
all those things as mere okes.

The grotto was an immense apartment. Along its granite floor ran our
faithful stream. At this distance from its spring the water was
scarcely tepid, and we drank of it with pleasure.

After breakfast the rofessor gave a few hours to the arrangement of
his daily notes.

First, said he,  will make a calculation to ascertain our eact
position.  hope, after our return, to draw a map of our ourney,
which will be in reality a vertical section of the globe, containing
the track of our epedition.

That will be curious, uncle but are your observations sufficiently
accurate to enable you to do this correctly?

es  have everywhere observed the angles and the inclines.  am
sure there is no error. et us see where we are now. Take your
compass, and note the direction.

Well, answered the rofessor, after a rapid calculation,  infer
that we have gone eightyfive leagues since we started.

Therefore we are under midAtlantic?

To be sure we are.

And perhaps at this very moment there is a storm above, and ships
over our heads are being rudely tossed by the tempest.

uite probable.

And whales are lashing the roof of our prison with their tails?

t may be, Ael, but they won't shake us here. ut let us go back to
our calculation. ere we are eightyfive leagues southeast of
Snfell, and  reckon that we are at a depth of siteen leagues.

Siteen leagues?  cried.

o doubt.

Why, this is the very limit assigned by science to the thickness of
the crust of the earth.

 don't deny it.

And here, according to the law of increasing temperature, there
ought to be a heat of , Fahr.

So there should, my lad.

And all this solid granite ought to be running in fusion.

ou see that it is not so, and that, as so often happens, facts come
to overthrow theories.

 am obliged to agree but, after all, it is surprising.

What does the thermometer say?

Twentyseven, si tenths  Fahr..

Therefore the savants are wrong by ,, and the proportional
increase is a mistake. Therefore umphry avy was right, and  am not
wrong in following him. What do you say now?

othing.

n truth,  had a good deal to say.  gave way in no respect to
avy's theory.  still held to the central heat, although  did not
feel its effects.  preferred to admit in truth, that this chimney of
an etinct volcano, lined with lavas, which are nonconductors of
heat, did not suffer the heat to pass through its walls.

ut without stopping to look up new arguments  simply took up our
situation such as it was.

Well, admitting all your calculations to be uite correct, you must
allow me to draw one rigid result therefrom.

What is it. Speak freely.

At the latitude of celand, where we now are, the radius of the
earth, the distance from the centre to the surface is about ,
leagues let us say in round numbers , leagues, or , miles.
ut of , leagues we have gone twelve

So you say.

And these twelve at a cost of  leagues diagonally?

Eactly so.

n twenty days?

es.

ow, siteen leagues are the hundredth part of the earth's radius.
At this rate we shall be two thousand days, or nearly five years and
a half, in getting to the centre.

o answer was vouchsafed to this rational conclusion. Without
reckoning, too, that if a vertical depth of siteen leagues can be
attained only by a diagonal descent of eightyfour, it follows that
we must go eight thousand miles in a southeasterly direction so
that we shall emerge from some point in the earth's circumference
instead of getting to the centre

Confusion to all your figures, and all your hypotheses besides,
shouted my uncle in a sudden rage. What is the basis of them all?
ow do you know that this passage does not run straight to our
destination? esides, there is a precedent. What one man has done,
another may do.

 hope so but, still,  may be permitted

ou shall have my leave to hold your tongue, Ael, but not to talk
in that irrational way.

 could see the awful rofessor bursting through my uncle's skin, and
 took timely warning.

ow look at your aneroid. What does that say?

t says we are under considerable pressure.

ery good so you see that by going gradually down, and getting
accustomed to the density of the atmosphere, we don't suffer at all.

othing, ecept a little pain in the ears.

That's nothing, and you may get rid of even that by uick breathing
whenever you feel the pain.

Eactly so,  said, determined not to say a word that might cross
my uncle's preudices. There is even positive pleasure in living in
this dense atmosphere. ave you observed how intense sound is down
here?

o doubt it is. A deaf man would soon learn to hear perfectly.

ut won't this density augment?

es according to a rather obscure law. t is well known that the
weight of bodies diminishes as fast as we descend. ou know that it
is at the surface of the globe that weight is most sensibly felt, and
that at the centre there is no weight at all.

 am aware of that but, tell me, will not air at last acuire the
density of water?

f course, under a pressure of seven hundred and ten atmospheres.

And how, lower down still?

ower down the density will still increase.

ut how shall we go down then.

Why, we must fill our pockets with stones.

Well, indeed, my worthy uncle, you are never at a loss for an
answer.

 dared venture no farther into the region of probabilities, for 
might presently have stumbled upon an impossibility, which would have
brought the rofessor on the scene when he was not wanted.

Still, it was evident that the air, under a pressure which might
reach that of thousands of atmospheres, would at last reach the solid
state, and then, even if our bodies could resist the strain, we
should be stopped, and no reasonings would be able to get us on any
farther.

ut  did not advance this argument. My uncle would have met it with
his inevitable Saknussemm, a precedent which possessed no weight with
me for even if the ourney of the learned celander were really
attested, there was one very simple answer, that in the siteenth
century there was neither barometer or aneroid and therefore
Saknussemm could not tell how far he had gone.

ut  kept this obection to myself, and waited the course of events.

t must be confessed that hitherto things had not gone on so badly,
and that  had small reason to complain. f our difficulties became
no worse, we might hope to reach our end. And to what a height of
scientific glory we should then attain  had become uite a
iedenbrock in my reasonings seriously  had. ut would this state
of things last in the strange place we had come to? erhaps it might.

For several days steeper inclines, some even frightfully near to the
perpendicular, brought us deeper and deeper into the mass of the
interior of the earth. Some days we advanced nearer to the centre by
a league and a half, or nearly two leagues. These were perilous
descents, in which the skill and marvellous coolness of ans were
invaluable to us. That unimpassioned celander devoted himself with
incomprehensible deliberation and, thanks to him, we crossed many a
dangerous spot which we should never have cleared alone.

ut his habit of silence gained upon him day by day, and was
infecting us. Eternal obects produce decided effects upon the
brain. A man shut up between four walls soon loses the power to
associate words and ideas together. ow many prisoners in solitary
confinement become idiots, if not mad, for want of eercise for the
thinking faculty

uring the fortnight following our last conversation, no incident
occurred worthy of being recorded. ut  have good reason for
remembering one very serious event which took place at this time, and
of which  could scarcely now forget the smallest details.

y the th of August our successive descents had brought us to a
depth of thirty leagues that is, that for a space of thirty leagues
there were over our heads solid beds of rock, ocean, continents, and
towns. We must have been two hundred leagues from celand.

n that day the tunnel went down a gentle slope.  was ahead of the
others. My uncle was carrying one of uhmkorff's lamps and  the
other.  was eamining the beds of granite.

Suddenly turning round  observed that  was alone.

Well, well,  thought  have been going too fast, or ans and my
uncle have stopped on the way. Come, this won't do  must oin them.
Fortunately there is not much of an ascent.

 began to feel uneasy. A shudder ran through me.

Calmly  said aloud to myself,  am sure to find my companions
again. There are not two roads.  was too far ahead.  will return

For half an hour  climbed up.  listened for a call, and in that
dense atmosphere a voice could reach very far. ut there was a dreary
silence in all that long gallery.  stopped.  could not believe that
 was lost.  was only bewildered for a time, not lost.  was sure 
should find my way again.

Come,  repeated, since there is but one road, and they are on it,
 must find them again.  have but to ascend still. nless, indeed,
missing me, and supposing me to be behind, they too should have gone
back. ut even in this case  have only to make the greater haste. 
shall find them,  am sure.

 repeated these words in the fainter tones of a halfconvinced man.
esides, to associate even such simple ideas with words, and reason
with them, was a work of time.

A doubt then seied upon me. Was  indeed in advance when we became
separated? es, to be sure  was. ans was after me, preceding my
uncle. e had even stopped for a while to strap his baggage better
over his shoulders.  could remember this little incident. t was at
that very moment that  must have gone on.

esides,  thought, have not  a guarantee that  shall not lose my
way, a clue in the labyrinth, that cannot be broken, my faithful
stream?  have but to trace it back, and  must come upon them.

This conclusion revived my spirits, and  resolved to resume my march
without loss of time.

ow  then blessed my uncle's foresight in preventing the hunter from
stopping up the hole in the granite. This beneficent spring, after
having satisfied our thirst on the road, would now be my guide among
the windings of the terrestrial crust.

efore starting afresh  thought a wash would do me good.  stooped
to bathe my face in the ansbach.

To my stupefaction and utter dismay my feet trod onlythe rough dry
granite. The stream was no longer at my feet.

ut how had  left the course of the stream? For it was a terrible
fact that it no longer ran at my side. Then  understood the reason
of that fearful, silence, when for the last time  listened to hear
if any sound from my companions could reach my ears. At the moment
when  left the right road  had not noticed the absence of the
stream. t is evident that at that moment a deviation had presented
itself before me, whilst the ansbach, following the caprice of
another incline, had gone with my companions away into unknown depths.

What human power could restore me to the light of the sun by rending
asunder the huge arches of rock which united over my head,
buttressing each other with impregnable strength? Who could place my
feet on the right path, and bring me back to my company?

h, my uncle burst from my lips in the tone of despair.

t was my only word of reproach, for  knew how much he must be
suffering in seeking me, wherever he might be.

When  saw myself thus far removed from all earthly help  had
recourse to heavenly succour. The remembrance of my childhood, the
recollection of my mother, whom  had only known in my tender early
years, came back to me, and  knelt in prayer imploring for the
ivine help of which  was so little worthy.

This return of trust in God's providence allayed the turbulence of my
fears, and  was enabled to concentrate upon my situation all the

Why had  not thought of that sooner? ere was evidently a chance of

the ansbach.  rose, and leaning upon my ironpointed stick 
ascended the gallery. The slope was rather steep.  walked on without
hope but without indecision, like a man who has made up his mind.

For half an hour  met with no obstacle.  tried to recognise my way
by the form of the tunnel, by the proections of certain rocks, by
the disposition of the fractures. ut no particular sign appeared,
and  soon saw that this gallery could not bring me back to the
turning point. t came to an abrupt end.  struck against an
impenetrable wall, and fell down upon the rock.

My last hope was shattered against this granite wall.

ost in this labyrinth, whose windings crossed each other in all
directions, it was no use to think of flight any longer. ere  must

came across me that when some day my petrified remains should be
found thirty leagues below the surface in the bowels of the earth,
the discovery might lead to grave scientific discussions.

 tried to speak aloud, but hoarse sounds alone passed my dry lips. 
panted for breath.

lamp had got wrong.  could not set it right, and its light was

 gaed painfully upon the luminous current growing weaker and weaker
in the wire coil. A dim procession of moving shadows seemed slowly
unfolding down the darkening walls.  scarcely dared to shut my eyes
for one moment, for fear of losing the least glimmer of this precious
light. Every instant it seemed about to vanish and the dense
blackness to come rolling in palpably upon me.

ne last trembling glimmer shot feebly up.  watched it in trembling
and aniety  drank it in as if  could preserve it, concentrating
upon it the full power of my eyes, as upon the very last sensation of
light which they were ever to eperience, and the net moment  lay
in the heavy gloom of deep, thick, unfathomable darkness.

A terrible cry of anguish burst from me. pon earth, in the midst of
the darkest night, light never abdicates its functions altogether. t
is still subtle and diffusive, but whatever little there may be, the
eye still catches that little. ere there was not an atom the total
darkness made me totally blind.

Then  began to lose my head.  arose with my arms stretched out
before me, attempting painfully to feel my way.  began to run
wildly, hurrying through the inetricable mae, still descending,
still running through the substance of the earth's thick crust, a
struggling denien of geological 'faults,' crying, shouting, yelling,
soon bruised by contact with the agged rock, falling and rising
again bleeding, trying to drink the blood which covered my face, and
even waiting for some rock to shatter my skull against.

When  returned to partial life my face was wet with tears. ow long
that state of insensibility had lasted  cannot say.  had no means
now of taking account of time. ever was solitude eual to this,
never had any living being been so utterly forsaken.

After my fall  had lost a good deal of blood.  felt it flowing over
me. Ah how happy  should have been could  have died, and if death
were not yet to be gone through.  would think no longer.  drove
away every idea, and, conuered by my grief,  rolled myself to the
foot of the opposite wall.

Already  was feeling the approach of another faint, and was hoping
for complete annihilation, when a loud noise reached me. t was like
the distant rumble of continuous thunder, and  could hear its
sounding undulations rolling far away into the remote recesses of the
abyss.

Whence could this noise proceed? t must be from some phenomenon
proceeding in the great depths amidst which  lay helpless. Was it an
eplosion of gas? Was it the fall of some mighty pillar of the globe?

 listened still.  wanted to know if the noise would be repeated. A
uarter of an hour passed away. Silence reigned in this gallery. 
could not hear even the beating of my heart.

Suddenly my ear, resting by chance against the wall, caught, or
seemed to catch, certain vague, indescribable, distant, articulate
sounds, as of words.

This is a delusion,  thought.

ut it was not. istening more attentively,  heard in reality a
murmuring of voices. ut my weakness prevented me from understanding
what the voices said. et it was language,  was sure of it.

For a moment  feared the words might be my own, brought back by the
echo. erhaps  had been crying out unknown to myself.  closed my
lips firmly, and laid my ear against the wall again.

es, truly, some one is speaking those are words

Even a few feet from the wall  could hear distinctly.  succeeded in
catching uncertain, strange, undistinguishable words. They came as if
pronounced in low murmured whispers. The word 'forlorad' was
several times repeated in a tone of sympathy and sorrow.

elp  cried with all my might. elp

 listened,  watched in the darkness for an answer, a cry, a mere
breath of sound, but nothing came. Some minutes passed. A whole world
of ideas had opened in my mind.  thought that my weakened voice
could never penetrate to my companions.

t is they,  repeated. What other men can be thirty leagues under
ground?

 again began to listen. assing my ear over the wall from one place
to another,  found the point where the voices seemed to be best
heard. The word 'forlorad' again returned then the rolling of
thunder which had roused me from my lethargy.

o,  said, no it is not through such a mass that a voice can be
heard.  am surrounded by granite walls, and the loudest eplosion
could never be heard here This noise comes along the gallery. There
must be here some remarkable eercise of acoustic laws

 listened again, and this time, yes this time,  did distinctly hear
my name pronounced across the wide interval.

t was my uncle's own voice e was talking to the guide. And
'forlorad' is a anish word.

Then  understood it all. To make myself heard,  must speak along
this wall, which would conduct the sound of my voice ust as wire
conducts electricity.

ut there was no time to lose. f my companions moved but a few steps
away, the acoustic phenomenon would cease.  therefore approached the
wall, and pronounced these words as clearly as possible:

 waited with the deepest aniety. Sound does not travel with great
velocity. Even increased density air has no effect upon its rate of
travelling it merely augments its intensity. Seconds, which seemed
ages, passed away, and at last these words reached me:

Ael Ael is it you?

. . . .

on the ansbach, we fired our guns. ur voices are audible to each
other, but our hands cannot touch. ut don't despair, Ael t is a
great thing that we can hear each other.

. . . .

uring this time  had been reflecting. A vague hope was returning to
my heart. There was one thing  must know to begin with.  placed my
lips close to the wall, saying:

My uncle

. . . .

My boy came to me after a few seconds.

. . . .

We must know how far we are apart.

. . . .

That is easy.

ou have your chronometer?

Well, take it. ronounce my name, noting eactly the second when you
speak.  will repeat it as soon as it shall come to me, and you will
observe the eact moment when you get my answer.

indicate that which my voice will take in coming to you.

. . . .

ust so, my uncle.

. . . .

Are you ready?

. . . .

. . . . . .

ow, attention.  am going to call your name.

. . . .

 put my ear to the wall, and as soon as the name 'Ael' came 
immediately replied Ael, then waited.

. . . .

Forty seconds, said my uncle. Forty seconds between the two words
so the sound takes twenty seconds in coming. ow, at the rate of
, feet in a second, this is , feet, or four miles and a
uarter, nearly.

. . . .

Four miles and a uarter  murmured.

. . . .

t will soon be over, Ael.

. . . .

Must  go up or down?

. . . .

ownfor this reason: We are in a vast chamber, with endless
galleries. ours must lead into it, for it seems as if all the clefts
and fractures of the globe radiated round this vast cavern. So get
up, and begin walking. Walk on, drag yourself along, if necessary
slide down the steep places, and at the end you will find us ready to
receive you. ow begin moving.

. . . .

These words cheered me up.

Good bye, uncle.  cried.  am going. There will be no more voices
heard when once  have started. So good bye

. . . .

Good bye, Ael, au revoir

. . . .

These were the last words  heard.

This wonderful underground conversation, carried on with a distance
of four miles and a uarter between us, concluded with these words of
hope.  thanked God from my heart, for it was e who had conducted me
through those vast solitudes to the point where, alone of all others
perhaps, the voices of my companions could have reached me.

This acoustic effect is easily eplained on scientific grounds. t
arose from the concave form of the gallery and the conducting power
of the rock. There are many eamples of this propagation of sounds
which remain unheard in the intermediate space.  remember that a
similar phenomenon has been observed in many places amongst others
on the internal surface of the gallery of the dome of St. aul's in
ondon, and especially in the midst of the curious caverns among the
uarries near Syracuse, the most wonderful of which is called
ionysius' Ear.

These remembrances came into my mind, and  clearly saw that since my
uncle's voice really reached me, there could be no obstacle between
us. Following the direction by which the sound came, of course 
should arrive in his presence, if my strength did not fail me.

 therefore rose  rather dragged myself than walked. The slope was
rapid, and  slid down.

Soon the swiftness of the descent increased horribly, and threatened
to become a fall.  no longer had the strength to stop myself.

Suddenly there was no ground under me.  felt myself revolving in
air, striking and rebounding against the craggy proections of a
vertical gallery, uite a well my head struck against a sharp corner
of the rock, and  became unconscious.

the least sign of life. At my first sigh he took my hand when

all our travelling gear, was in a charming grotto, adorned with
splendid stalactites, and the soil of which was a fine sand. t was

glimpses of light came from without through a narrow opening in the
grotto.  heard too a vague and indistinct noise, something like the
murmuring of waves breaking upon a shingly shore, and at times 
seemed to hear the whistling of wind.

craed by my fall, was not affected by imaginary noises. et neither
eyes, nor ears could be so utterly deceived.

t is a ray of daylight,  thought, sliding in through this cleft in

noise of wind. Am  uite mistaken, or have we returned to the
surface of the earth? as my uncle given up the epedition, or is it
happily terminated?

entered.

Good morning, Ael, he cried cheerily.  feel sure you are better.

and  watched you by turns, and we have noticed you were evidently
recovering.

of that presently if you will let me have my breakfast.

ou shall eat, lad. The fever has left you. ans rubbed your wounds
with some ointment or other of which the celanders keep the secret,
and they have healed marvellously. ur hunter is a splendid fellow

Whilst he went on talking, my uncle prepared a few provisions, which
 devoured eagerly, notwithstanding his advice to the contrary. All
the while  was overwhelming him with uestions which he answered
readily.

 then learnt that my providential fall had brought me eactly to the
etremity of an almost perpendicular shaft and as  had landed in
the midst of an accompanying torrent of stones, the least of which
would have been enough to crush me, the conclusion was that a loose
portion of the rock had come down with me. This frightful conveyance
had thus carried me into the arms of my uncle, where  fell bruised,
bleeding, and insensible.

Truly it is wonderful that you have not been killed a hundred times
over. ut, for the love of God, don't let us ever separate again, or
we many never see each other more.

ot separate s the ourney not over, then?  opened a pair of
astonished eyes, which immediately called for the uestion:

And all my limbs unbroken?

Certainly.

And my head?

shoulders, where it ought to be.

Well,  am afraid my brain is affected.

Ah is that all?

o tell me all about it.

A little patience, my nephew. A relapse might get us into trouble,

Set sailand  almost leaped up.

What did it all mean? ad we a river, a lake, a sea to depend upon?
Was there a ship at our disposal in some underground harbour?

My curiosity was highly ecited, my uncle vainly tried to restrain
me. When he saw that my impatience was doing me harm, he yielded.

A EW MAE TEM


At first  could hardly see anything. My eyes, unaccustomed to the
light, uickly closed. When  was able to reopen them,  stood more
stupefied even than surprised.

The sea  cried.

es, my uncle replied, the iedenbrock Sea and  don't suppose
any other discoverer will ever dispute my claim to name it after
myself as its first discoverer.

A vast sheet of water, the commencement of a lake or an ocean, spread
far away beyond the range of the eye, reminding me forcibly of that
open sea which drew from enophon's ten thousand Greeks, after their
long retreat, the simultaneous cry, Thalatta thalatta the sea
the sea The deeply indented shore was lined with a breadth of fine
shining sand, softly lapped by the waves, and strewn with the small
shells which had been inhabited by the first of created beings. The
waves broke on this shore with the hollow echoing murmur peculiar to
vast inclosed spaces. A light foam flew over the waves before the
breath of a moderate breee, and some of the spray fell upon my face.
n this slightly inclining shore, about a hundred fathoms from the
limit of the waves, came down the foot of a huge wall of vast cliffs,
which rose maestically to an enormous height. Some of these,
dividing the beach with their sharp spurs, formed capes and
promontories, worn away by the ceaseless action of the surf. Farther
on the eye discerned their massive outline sharply defined against
the hay distant horion.

t was uite an ocean, with the irregular shores of earth, but desert
and frightfully wild in appearance.

f my eyes were able to range afar over this great sea, it was
because a peculiar light brought to view every detail of it. t was
not the light of the sun, with his daling shafts of brightness and
the splendour of his rays nor was it the pale and uncertain shimmer
of the moonbeams, the dim reflection of a nobler body of light. o
the illuminating power of this light, its trembling diffusiveness,
its bright, clear whiteness, and its low temperature, showed that it
must be of electric origin. t was like an aurora borealis, a
continuous cosmical phenomenon, filling a cavern of sufficient etent
to contain an ocean.

The vault that spanned the space above, the sky, if it could be
called so, seemed composed of vast plains of cloud, shifting and
variable vapours, which by their condensation must at certain times
fall in torrents of rain.  should have thought that under so
powerful a pressure of the atmosphere there could be no evaporation
and yet, under a law unknown to me, there were broad tracts of vapour
suspended in the air. ut then 'the weather was fine.' The play of
the electric light produced singular effects upon the upper strata of
cloud. eep shadows reposed upon their lower wreaths and often,
between two separated fields of cloud, there glided down a ray of
unspeakable lustre. ut it was not solar light, and there was no
heat. The general effect was sad, supremely melancholy. nstead of
the shining firmament, spangled with its innumerable stars, shining
singly or in clusters,  felt that all these subdued and shaded
lights were ribbed in by vast walls of granite, which seemed to
overpower me with their weight, and that all this space, great as it
was, would not be enough for the march of the humblest of satellites.

Then  remembered the theory of an English captain, who likened the
earth to a vast hollow sphere, in the interior of which the air
became luminous because of the vast pressure that weighed upon it
while two stars, luto and roserpine, rolled within upon the circuit
of their mysterious orbits.

We were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable ecavation. ts
width could not be estimated, since the shore ran widening as far as
eye could reach, nor could its length, for the dim horion bounded
the new. As for its height, it must have been several leagues. Where
this vault rested upon its granite base no eye could tell but there
was a cloud hanging far above, the height of which we estimated at
, feet, a greater height than that of any terrestrial vapour,
and no doubt due to the great density of the air.

The word cavern does not convey any idea of this immense space words
of human tongue are inadeuate to describe the discoveries of him who
ventures into the deep abysses of earth.

esides  could not tell upon what geological theory to account for
the eistence of such an ecavation. ad the cooling of the globe
produced it?  knew of celebrated caverns from the descriptions of
travellers, but had never heard of any of such dimensions as this.

f the grotto of Guachara, in Colombia, visited by umboldt, had not
given up the whole of the secret of its depth to the philosopher, who
investigated it to the depth of , feet, it probably did not
etend much farther. The immense mammoth cave in entucky is of
gigantic proportions, since its vaulted roof rises five hundred feet
 above the level of an unfathomable lake and travellers have
eplored its ramifications to the etent of forty miles. ut what
were these cavities compared to that in which  stood with wonder and
admiration, with its sky of luminous vapours, its bursts of electric
light, and a vast sea filling its bed? My imagination fell powerless
before such immensity.

 gaed upon these wonders in silence. Words failed me to epress my
feelings.  felt as if  was in some distant planet ranus or
eptuneand in the presence of phenomena of which my terrestrial
eperience gave me no cognisance. For such novel sensations, new words
were wanted and my imagination failed to supply them.  gaed, 
thought,  admired, with a stupefaction mingled with a certain amount of
fear.

The unforeseen nature of this spectacle brought back the colour to my
cheeks.  was under a new course of treatment with the aid of
astonishment, and my convalescence was promoted by this novel system
of therapeutics besides, the dense and breey air invigorated me,
supplying more oygen to my lungs.

t will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven
days in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enoyment to
breathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles.

 was delighted to leave my dark grotto. My uncle, already familiar
with these wonders, had ceased to feel surprise.

ou feel strong enough to walk a little way now? he asked.

es, certainly and nothing could be more delightful.

Well, take my arm, Ael, and let us follow the windings of the
shore.

 eagerly accepted, and we began to coast along this new sea. n the
left huge pyramids of rock, piled one upon another, produced a
prodigious titanic effect. own their sides flowed numberless
waterfalls, which went on their way in brawling but pellucid streams.
A few light vapours, leaping from rock to rock, denoted the place of
hot springs and streams flowed softly down to the common basin,
gliding down the gentle slopes with a softer murmur.

Amongst these streams  recognised our faithful travelling companion,
the ansbach, coming to lose its little volume uietly in the mighty
sea, ust as if it had done nothing else since the beginning of the
world.

We shall see it no more,  said, with a sigh.

What matters, replied the philosopher, whether this or another
serves to guide us?

 thought him rather ungrateful.

ut at that moment my attention was drawn to an unepected sight. At
a distance of five hundred paces, at the turn of a high promontory,
appeared a high, tufted, dense forest. t was composed of trees of
moderate height, formed like umbrellas, with eact geometrical
outlines. The currents of wind seemed to have had no effect upon
their shape, and in the midst of the windy blasts they stood unmoved
and firm, ust like a clump of petrified cedars.

 hastened forward.  could not give any name to these singular
creations. Were they some of the two hundred thousand species of
vegetables known hitherto, and did they claim a place of their own in
the lacustrine flora? o when we arrived under their shade my
surprise turned into admiration. There stood before me productions of
earth, but of gigantic stature, which my uncle immediately named.

t is only a forest of mushrooms, said he.

And he was right. magine the large development attained by these
plants, which prefer a warm, moist climate.  knew that the
ycopodon giganteum attains, according to ulliard, a circumference
of eight or nine feet but here were pale mushrooms, thirty to forty
feet high, and crowned with a cap of eual diameter. There they stood
in thousands. o light could penetrate between their huge cones, and
complete darkness reigned beneath those giants they formed
settlements of domes placed in close array like the round, thatched
roofs of a central African city.

et  wanted to penetrate farther underneath, though a chill fell
upon me as soon as  came under those cellular vaults. For half an
hour we wandered from side to side in the damp shades, and it was a
comfortable and pleasant change to arrive once more upon the sea
shore.

ut the subterranean vegetation was not confined to these fungi.
Farther on rose groups of tall trees of colourless foliage and easy
to recognise. They were lowly shrubs of earth, here attaining
gigantic sie lycopodiums, a hundred feet high the huge sigillaria,
found in our coal mines tree ferns, as tall as our firtrees in
northern latitudes lepidodendra, with cylindrical forked stems,
terminated by long leaves, and bristling with rough hairs like those
of the cactus.

Wonderful, magnificent, splendid cried my uncle. ere is the

early ages. ook, Ael, and admire it all. ever had botanist such a

ou are right, my uncle. rovidence seems to have preserved in this
immense conservatory the antediluvian plants which the wisdom of
philosophers has so sagaciously put together again.

t is a conservatory, Ael but is it not also a menagerie?

Surely not a menagerie

es no doubt of it. ook at that dust under your feet see the
bones scattered on the ground.

So there are  cried bones of etinct animals.

 had rushed upon these remains, formed of indestructible phosphates
of lime, and without hesitation  named these monstrous bones, which
lay scattered about like decayed trunks of trees.

ere is the lower aw of a mastodon,   said. These are the
molar teeth of the deinotherium this femur must have belonged to the
greatest of those beasts, the megatherium. t certainly is a
menagerie, for these remains were not brought here by a deluge. The
animals to which they belonged roamed on the shores of this
subterranean sea, under the shade of those arborescent trees. ere
are entire skeletons. And yet  cannot understand the appearance of
these uadrupeds in a granite cavern.

 These animals belonged to a late geological period, the liocene,
ust before the glacial epoch, and therefore could have no connection
with the carboniferous vegetation. Trans.

Why?

ecause animal life eisted upon the earth only in the secondary
period, when a sediment of soil had been deposited by the rivers, and
taken the place of the incandescent rocks of the primitive period.

Well, Ael, there is a very simple answer to your obection that
this soil is alluvial.

What at such a depth below the surface of the earth?

o doubt and there is a geological eplanation of the fact. At a
certain period the earth consisted only of an elastic crust or bark,
alternately acted on by forces from above or below, according to the
laws of attraction and gravitation. robably there were subsidences
of the outer crust, when a portion of the sedimentary deposits was
carried down sudden openings.

That may be,  replied but if there have been creatures now
etinct in these underground regions, why may not some of those
monsters be now roaming through these gloomy forests, or hidden
behind the steep crags?

And as this unpleasant notion got hold of me,  surveyed with anious
scrutiny the open spaces before me but no living creature appeared
upon the barren strand.

 felt rather tired, and went to sit down at the end of a promontory,
at the foot of which the waves came and beat themselves into spray.
Thence my eye could sweep every part of the bay within its etremity
a little harbour was formed between the pyramidal cliffs, where the
still waters slept untouched by the boisterous winds. A brig and two
or three schooners might have moored within it in safety.  almost
fancied  should presently see some ship issue from it, full sail,
and take to the open sea under the southern breee.

ut this illusion lasted a very short time. We were the only living
creatures in this subterranean world. When the wind lulled, a deeper
silence than that of the deserts fell upon the arid, naked rocks, and
weighed upon the surface of the ocean.  then desired to pierce the
distant hae, and to rend asunder the mysterious curtain that hung
across the horion. Anious ueries arose to my lips. Where did that
sea terminate? Where did it lead to? Should we ever know anything
about its opposite shores?

My uncle made no doubt about it at all  both desired and feared.

After spending an hour in the contemplation of this marvellous
spectacle, we returned to the shore to regain the grotto, and  fell
asleep in the midst of the strangest thoughts.

The net morning  awoke feeling perfectly well.  thought a bathe
would do me good, and  went to plunge for a few minutes into the
waters of this mediterranean sea, for assuredly it better deserved
this name than any other sea.

 came back to breakfast with a good appetite. ans was a good
caterer for our little household he had water and fire at his
disposal, so that he was able to vary our bill of fare now and then.
For dessert he gave us a few cups of coffee, and never was coffee so
delicious.

ow, said my uncle, now is the time for high tide, and we must not
lose the opportunity to study this phenomenon.

What the tide  cried. Can the influence of the sun and moon be
felt down here?

Why not? Are not all bodies subect throughout their mass to the
power of universal attraction? This mass of water cannot escape the
general law. And in spite of the heavy atmospheric pressure on the
surface, you will see it rise like the Atlantic itself.

At the same moment we reached the sand on the shore, and the waves
were by slow degrees encroaching on the shore.

ere is the tide rising,  cried.

es, Ael and udging by these ridges of foam, you may observe that
the sea will rise about twelve feet.

This is wonderful,  said.

o it is uite natural.

ou may say so, uncle but to me it is most etraordinary, and  can
hardly believe my eyes. Who would ever have imagined, under this
terrestrial crust, an ocean with ebbing and flowing tides, with winds
and storms?

Well, replied my uncle, is there any scientific reason against it?

o  see none, as soon as the theory of central heat is given up.
So then, thus far, he answered, the theory of Sir umphry avy is
confirmed.

Evidently it is and now there is no reason why there should not be
seas and continents in the interior of the earth.

o doubt, said my uncle and inhabited too.

To be sure, said  and why should not these waters yield to us
fishes of unknown species?

At any rate, he replied, we have not seen any yet.

Well, let us make some lines, and see if the bait will draw here as
it does in sublunary regions.

We will try, Ael, for we must penetrate all secrets of these newly
discovered regions.

ut where are we, uncle? for  have not yet asked you that uestion,
and your instruments must be able to furnish the answer.

oriontally, three hundred and fifty leagues from celand.

So much as that?

 am sure of not being a mile out of my reckoning.

And does the compass still show southeast?

es with a westerly deviation of nineteen degrees fortyfive
minutes, ust as above ground. As for its dip, a curious fact is
coming to light, which  have observed carefully: that the needle,
instead of dipping towards the pole as in the northern hemisphere, on
the contrary, rises from it.

Would you then conclude,  said, that the magnetic pole is
somewhere between the surface of the globe and the point where we
are?

Eactly so and it is likely enough that if we were to reach the
spot beneath the polar regions, about that seventyfirst degree where
Sir ames oss has discovered the magnetic pole to be situated, we
should see the needle point straight up. Therefore that mysterious
centre of attraction is at no great depth.

 remarked: t is so and here is a fact which science has scarcely
suspected.

Science, my lad, has been built upon many errors but they are
errors which it was good to fall into, for they led to the truth.

What depth have we now reached?

We are thirtyfive leagues below the surface.

So,  said, eamining the map, the ighlands of Scotland are over
our heads, and the Grampians are raising their rugged summits above
us.

es, answered the rofessor laughing. t is rather a heavy weight
to bear, but a solid arch spans over our heads. The great Architect
has built it of the best materials and never could man have given it
so wide a stretch. What are the finest arches of bridges and the
arcades of cathedrals, compared with this far reaching vault, with a
radius of three leagues, beneath which a wide and tempesttossed
ocean may flow at its ease?

h,  am not afraid that it will fall down upon my head. ut now
what are your plans? Are you not thinking of returning to the surface
now?

eturn no, indeed We will continue our ourney, everything having
gone on well so far.

ut how are we to get down below this liuid surface?

h,  am not going to dive head foremost. ut if all oceans are
properly speaking but lakes, since they are encompassed by land, of
course this internal sea will be surrounded by a coast of granite,
and on the opposite shores we shall find fresh passages opening.

ow long do you suppose this sea to be?

Thirty or forty leagues so that we have no time to lose, and we
shall set sail tomorrow.

Set sail, shall we? ut  should like to see my boat first.

t will not be a boat at all, but a good, wellmade raft.

Why,  said, a raft would be ust as hard to make as a boat, and 
don't see

you hear the hammer at work? ans is already busy at it.

What, has he already felled the trees?

h, the trees were already down. Come, and you will see for
yourself.

After half an hour's walking, on the other side of the promontory
which formed the little natural harbour,  perceived ans at work. n
a few more steps  was at his side. To my great surprise a
halffinished raft was already lying on the sand, made of a peculiar
kind of wood, and a great number of planks, straight and bent, and of
frames, were covering the ground, enough almost for a little fleet.

ncle, what wood is this?  cried.

t is fir, pine, or birch, and other northern coniferae, mineralised
by the action of the sea. t is called surturbrand, a variety of
brown coal or lignite, found chiefly in celand.

ut surely, then, like other fossil wood, it must be as hard as
stone, and cannot float?

Sometimes that may happen some of these woods become true
anthracites but others, such as this, have only gone through the
first stage of fossil transformation. ust look, added my uncle,
throwing into the sea one of those precious waifs.

The bit of wood, after disappearing, returned to the surface and
oscillated to and fro with the waves.

Are you convinced? said my uncle.

 am uite convinced, although it is incredible

y net evening, thanks to the industry and skill of our guide, the
raft was made. t was ten feet by five the planks of surturbrand,

WES F TE EE


n the th of August we awoke early. We were now to begin to adopt a
mode of travelling both more epeditious and less fatiguing than
hitherto.

A mast was made of two poles spliced together, a yard was made of a
third, a blanket borrowed from our coverings made a tolerable sail.
There was no want of cordage for the rigging, and everything was well
and firmly made.

The provisions, the baggage, the instruments, the guns, and a good
uantity of fresh water from the rocks around, all found their proper
places on board and at si the rofessor gave the signal to embark.
ans had fitted up a rudder to steer his vessel. e took the tiller,
and unmoored the sail was set, and we were soon afloat. At the
moment of leaving the harbour, my uncle, who was tenaciously fond of
naming his new discoveries, wanted to give it a name, and proposed
mine amongst others.

ut  have a better to propose,  said: Grauben. et it be called
ort Gruben it will look very well upon the map.

ort Gruben let it be then.

And so the cherished remembrance of my irlandaise became associated
with our adventurous epedition.

The wind was from the northwest. We went with it at a high rate of
speed. The dense atmosphere acted with great force and impelled us
swiftly on.

n an hour my uncle had been able to estimate our progress. At this
rate, he said, we shall make thirty leagues in twentyfour hours, and
we shall soon come in sight of the opposite shore.

 made no answer, but went and sat forward. The northern shore was
already beginning to dip under the horion. The eastern and western
strands spread wide as if to bid us farewell. efore our eyes lay far
and wide a vast sea shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its
silvergrey surface the glistening bluish rays of electric light,
here and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray, shot out
little sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear. Soon we
entirely lost sight of land no obect was left for the eye to udge
by, and but for the frothy track of the raft,  might have thought we
were standing still.

About twelve, immense shoals of seaweeds came in sight.  was aware
of the great powers of vegetation that characterise these plants,
which grow at a depth of twelve thousand feet, reproduce themselves
under a pressure of four hundred atmospheres, and sometimes form
barriers strong enough to impede the course of a ship. ut never, 
think, were such seaweeds as those which we saw floating in immense
waving lines upon the sea of iedenbrock.

ur raft skirted the whole length of the fuci, three or four thousand
feet long, undulating like vast serpents beyond the reach of sight 
found some amusement in tracing these endless waves, always thinking
 should come to the end of them, and for hours my patience was vying
with my surprise.

What natural force could have produced such plants, and what must
have been the appearance of the earth in the first ages of its
formation, when, under the action of heat and moisture, the vegetable
kingdom alone was developing on its surface?

Evening came, and, as on the previous day,  perceived no change in
the luminous condition of the air. t was a constant condition, the
permanency of which might be relied upon.

After supper  laid myself down at the foot of the mast, and fell
asleep in the midst of fantastic reveries.

ans, keeping fast by the helm, let the raft run on, which, after
all, needed no steering, the wind blowing directly aft.

Since our departure from ort Gruben, rofessor iedenbrock had
entrusted the log to my care  was to register every observation,
make entries of interesting phenomena, the direction of the wind, the
rate of sailing, the way we madein a word, every particular of our
singular voyage.

 shall therefore reproduce here these daily notes, written, so to
speak, as the course of events directed, in order to furnish an eact
narrative of our passage.

Friday, August .Wind steady, .W. The raft makes rapid way in
a direct line. Coast thirty leagues to leeward. othing in sight
before us. ntensity of light the same. Weather fine that is to say,
that the clouds are flying high, are light, and bathed in a white
atmosphere resembling silver in a state of fusion. Therm.  Fahr.

At noon ans prepared a hook at the end of a line. e baited it with
a small piece of meat and flung it into the sea. For two hours
nothing was caught. Are these waters, then, bare of inhabitants? o,
there's a pull at the line. ans draws it in and brings out a
struggling fish.

A sturgeon,  cried a small sturgeon.

The rofessor eyes the creature attentively, and his opinion differs
from mine.

The head of this fish was flat, but rounded in front, and the
anterior part of its body was plated with bony, angular scales it
had no teeth, its pectoral fins were large, and of tail there was
none. The animal belonged to the same order as the sturgeon, but
differed from that fish in many essential particulars. After a short
eamination my uncle pronounced his opinion.

This fish belongs to an etinct family, of which only fossil traces
are found in the devonian formations.

What  cried. ave we taken alive an inhabitant of the seas of
primitive ages?

es and you will observe that these fossil fishes have no identity
with any living species. To have in one's possession a living
specimen is a happy event for a naturalist.

ut to what family does it belong?

t is of the order of ganoids, of the family of the cephalaspidae
and a species of pterichthys. ut this one displays a peculiarity
confined to all fishes that inhabit subterranean waters. t is blind,
and not only blind, but actually has no eyes at all.

 looked: nothing could be more certain. ut supposing it might be a
solitary case, we baited afresh, and threw out our line. Surely this
ocean is well peopled with fish, for in another couple of hours we
took a large uantity of pterichthydes, as well as of others
belonging to the etinct family of the dipterides, but of which my
uncle could not tell the species none had organs of sight. This
unhopedfor catch recruited our stock of provisions.

Thus it is evident that this sea contains none but species known to
us in their fossil state, in which fishes as well as reptiles are the
less perfectly and completely organised the farther back their date
of creation.

erhaps we may yet meet with some of those saurians which science has
reconstructed out of a bit of bone or cartilage.  took up the
telescope and scanned the whole horion, and found it everywhere a
desert sea. We are far away removed from the shores.

 gae upward in the air. Why should not some of the strange birds
restored by the immortal Cuvier again flap their 'sailbroad vans' in
this dense and heavy atmosphere? There are sufficient fish for their
support.  survey the whole space that stretches overhead it is as
desert as the shore was.

Still my imagination carried me away amongst the wonderful
speculations of palontology. Though awake  fell into a dream. 
thought  could see floating on the surface of the waters enormous
chelonia, preadamite tortoises, resembling floating islands. ver the
dimly lighted strand there trod the huge mammals of the first ages of
the world, the leptotherium slender beast, found in the caverns of
rail the merycotherium ruminating beast, found in the 'drift' of
iceclad Siberia. Farther on, the pachydermatous lophiodon crested
toothed, a gigantic tapir, hides behind the rocks to dispute its
prey with the anoplotherium unarmed beast, a strange creature,
which seemed a compound of horse, rhinoceros, camel, and
hippopotamus. The colossal mastodon nippletoothed twists and
untwists his trunk, and brays and pounds with his huge tusks the
fragments of rock that cover the shore whilst the megatherium huge
beast, buttressed upon his enormous hinder paws, grubs in the soil,
awaking the sonorous echoes of the granite rocks with his tremendous
roarings. igher up, the protopithecathe first monkey that
appeared on the globeis climbing up the steep ascents. igher yet,
the pterodactyle wingfingered darts in irregular igags to and
fro in the heavy air. n the uppermost regions of the air immense
birds, more powerful than the cassowary, and larger than the ostrich,
spread their vast breadth of wings and strike with their heads the
granite vault that bounds the sky.

All this fossil world rises to life again in my vivid imagination. 
return to the scriptural periods or ages of the world, conventionally
called 'days,' long before the appearance of man, when the unfinished
world was as yet unfitted for his support. Then my dream backed even
farther still into the ages before the creation of living beings. The
mammals disappear, then the birds vanish, then the reptiles of the
secondary period, and finally the fish, the crustaceans, molluscs,
and articulated beings. Then the oophytes of the transition period
also return to nothing.  am the only living thing in the world: all
life is concentrated in my beating heart alone. There are no more
seasons climates are no more the heat of the globe continually
increases and neutralises that of the sun. egetation becomes
accelerated.  glide like a shade amongst arborescent ferns, treading
with unsteady feet the coloured marls and the particoloured clays 
lean for support against the trunks of immense conifers  lie in the
shade of sphenophylla wedgeleaved, asterophylla starleaved, and
lycopods, a hundred feet high.

Ages seem no more than days  am passed, against my will, in
retrograde order, through the long series of terrestrial changes.
lants disappear granite rocks soften intense heat converts solid
bodies into thick fluids the waters again cover the face of the
earth they boil, they rise in whirling eddies of steam white and
ghastly mists wrap round the shifting forms of the earth, which by
imperceptible degrees dissolves into a gaseous mass, glowing fiery
red and white, as large and as shining as the sun.

And  myself am floating with wild caprice in the midst of this
nebulous mass of fourteen hundred thousand times the volume of the
earth into which it will one day be condensed, and carried forward
amongst the planetary bodies. My body is no longer firm and
terrestrial it is resolved into its constituent atoms, subtilised,
volatilised. Sublimed into imponderable vapour,  mingle and am lost
in the endless foods of those vast globular volumes of vaporous
mists, which roll upon their flaming orbits through infinite space.

ut is it not a dream? Whither is it carrying me? My feverish hand
has vainly attempted to describe upon paper its strange and wonderful
details.  have forgotten everything that surrounds me. The
rofessor, the guide, the raftare all gone out of my ken. An
illusion has laid hold upon me.

What is the matter? my uncle breaks in.

My staring eyes are fied vacantly upon him.

Take care, Ael, or you will fall overboard.

At that moment  felt the sinewy hand of ans seiing me vigorously.
ut for him, carried away by my dream,  should have thrown myself
into the sea.

s he mad? cried the rofessor.

What is it all about? at last  cried, returning to myself.

o you feel ill? my uncle asked.

o but  have had a strange hallucination it is over now. s all
going on right?

es, it is a fair wind and a fine sea we are sailing rapidly along,
and if  am not out in my reckoning, we shall soon land.

At these words  rose and gaed round upon the horion, still
everywhere bounded by clouds alone.

A ATTE F MSTES


Saturday, August .The sea unbroken all round. o land in
sight. The horion seems etremely distant.

My head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream.

My uncle has had no dreams, but he is out of temper. e eamines the
horion all round with his glass, and folds his arms with the air of
an inured man.

 remark that rofessor iedenbrock has a tendency to relapse into an
impatient mood, and  make a note of it in my log. All my danger and
sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of
him but now that  am well his nature has resumed its sway. And yet,
what cause was there for anger? s not the voyage prospering as
favourably as possible under the circumstances? s not the raft
spinning along with marvellous speed?

ou seem anious, my uncle,  said, seeing him continually with
his glass to his eye.

Anious o, not at all.

mpatient, then?

ne might be, with less reason than now.

et we are going very fast.

What does that signify?  am not complaining that the rate is slow,
but that the sea is so wide.

 then remembered that the rofessor, before starting, had estimated
the length of this underground sea at thirty leagues. ow we had made
three times the distance, yet still the southern coast was not in
sight.

We are not descending as we ought to be, the rofessor declares.
We are losing time, and the fact is,  have not come all this way to
take a little sail upon a pond on a raft.

e called this sea a pond, and our long voyage, taking a little sail

ut,  remarked, since we have followed the road that Saknussemm
has shown us

That is ust the uestion. ave we followed that road? id
Saknussemm meet this sheet of water? id he cross it? as not the
stream that we followed led us altogether astray?

At any rate we cannot feel sorry to have come so far. This prospect
is magnificent, and

ut  don't care for prospects.  came with an obect, and  mean to
attain it. Therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects.

 take this as my answer, and  leave the rofessor to bite his lips
with impatience. At si in the evening ans asks for his wages, and
his three ri dollars are counted out to him.

Sunday, August . othing new. Weather unchanged. The wind
freshens. n awaking, my first thought was to observe the intensity
of the light.  was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric
light should grow dim, or fail altogether. ut there seemed no reason
to fear. The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface
of the waves.

Truly this sea is of infinite width. t must be as wide as the
Mediterranean or the Atlanticand why not?

My uncle took soundings several times. e tied the heaviest of our
pickaes to a long rope which he let down two hundred fathoms. o
bottom yet and we had some difficulty in hauling up our plummet.

ut when the pick was shipped again, ans pointed out on its surface
deep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard
bodies.

 looked at the hunter.

Tnder, said he.

 could not understand him, and turned to my uncle who was entirely
absorbed in his calculations.  had rather not disturb him while he
is uiet.  return to the celander. e by a snapping motion of his
aws conveys his ideas to me.

Teeth  cried, considering the iron bar with more attention.

es, indeed, those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal
The aws which they arm must be possessed of amaing strength. s
there some monster beneath us belonging to the etinct races, more
voracious than the shark, more fearful in vastness than the whale? 
could not take my eyes off this indented iron bar. Surely will my
last night's dream be realised?

These thoughts agitated me all day, and my imagination scarcely
calmed down after several hours' sleep.

Monday, August .  am trying to recall the peculiar instincts
of the monsters of the preadamite world, who, coming net in
succession after the molluscs, the crustaceans and le fishes,
preceded the animals of mammalian race upon the earth. The world then
belonged to reptiles. Those monsters held the mastery in the seas of
the secondary period. They possessed a perfect organisation, gigantic
proportions, prodigious strength. The saurians of our day, the
alligators and the crocodiles, are but feeble reproductions of their
forefathers of primitive ages.

 shudder as  recall these monsters to my remembrance. o human eye
has ever beheld them living. They burdened this earth a thousand ages
before man appeared, but their fossil remains, found in the
argillaceous limestone called by the English the lias, have enabled
their colossal structure to be perfectly built up again and
anatomically ascertained.

 saw at the amburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures
thirty feet in length. Am  then fated, a denien of earthto
be placed face to face with these representatives of long etinct
families? o surely it cannot be et the deep marks of conical
teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.

My eyes are fearfully bent upon the sea.  dread to see one of these
monsters darting forth from its submarine caverns.  suppose
rofessor iedenbrock was of my opinion too, and even shared my
fears, for after having eamined the pick, his eyes traversed the
ocean from side to side. What a very bad notion that was of his, 
thought to myself, to take soundings ust here e has disturbed some
monstrous beast in its remote den, and if we are not attacked on our
voyage

 look at our guns and see that they are all right. My uncle notices
it, and looks on approvingly.

Already widely disturbed regions on the surface of the water indicate
some commotion below. The danger is approaching. We must be on the
look out.

Tuesday, August . Evening came, or rather the time came when
sleep weighs down the weary eyelids, for there is no night here, and
the ceaseless light wearies the eyes with its persistency ust as if
we were sailing under an arctic sun. ans was at the helm. uring his
watch  slept.

Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me. The raft was heaved
up on a watery mountain and pitched down again, at a distance of
twenty fathoms.

What is the matter? shouted my uncle. ave we struck land?

ans pointed with his finger at a dark mass si hundred yards away,
rising and falling alternately with heavy plunges.  looked and cried:

t is an enormous porpoise.

es, replied my uncle, and there is a sea liard of vast sie.

And farther on a monstrous crocodile. ook at its vast aws and its
rows of teeth t is diving down

There's a whale, a whale cried the rofessor.  can see its great
fins. See how he is throwing out air and water through his blowers.

And in fact two liuid columns were rising to a considerable height
above the sea. We stood amaed, thunderstruck, at the presence of
such a herd of marine monsters. They were of supernatural dimensions
the smallest of them would have crunched our raft, crew and all, at
one snap of its huge aws.

ans wants to tack to get away from this dangerous neighbourhood but
he sees on the other hand enemies not less terrible a tortoise forty
feet long, and a serpent of thirty, lifting its fearful head and
gleaming eyes above the flood.

Flight was out of the uestion now. The reptiles rose they wheeled
around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of epress
trains. They described around us gradually narrowing circles.  took
up my rifle. ut what could a ball do against the scaly armour with
which these enormous beasts were clad?

We stood dumb with fear. They approach us close: on one side the
crocodile, on the other the serpent. The remainder of the sea
monsters have disappeared.  prepare to fire. ans stops me by a
gesture. The two monsters pass within a hundred and fifty yards of
the raft, and hurl themselves the one upon the other, with a fury
which prevents them from seeing us.

At three hundred yards from us the battle was fought. We could
distinctly observe the two monsters engaged in deadly conflict. ut
it now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the
fraythe porpoise, the whale, the liard, the tortoise. Every
moment  seem to see one or other of them.  point them to the
celander. e shakes his head negatively.

Tva, says he.

What two? oes he mean that there are only two animals?

e is right, said my uncle, whose glass has never left his eye.

Surely you must be mistaken,  cried.

o: the first of those monsters has a porpoise's snout, a liard's
head, a crocodile's teeth and hence our mistake. t is the
ichthyosaurus the fish liard, the most terrible of the ancient
monsters of the deep.

And the other?

The other is a plesiosaurus almost liard, a serpent, armoured
with the carapace and the paddles of a turtle he is the dreadful
enemy of the other.

ans had spoken truly. Two monsters only were creating all this
commotion and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive
world.  can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a
redhot coal, and as large as a man's head. ature has endowed it
with an optical apparatus of etreme power, and capable of resisting
the pressure of the great volume of water in the depths it inhabits.
t has been appropriately called the saurian whale, for it has both
the swiftness and the rapid movements of this monster of our own day.
This one is not less than a hundred feet long, and  can udge of its
sie when it sweeps over the waters the vertical coils of its tail.
ts aw is enormous, and according to naturalists it is armed with no
less than one hundred and eightytwo teeth.

The plesiosaurus, a serpent with a cylindrical body and a short tail,
has four flappers or paddles to act like oars. ts body is entirely
covered with a thick armour of scales, and its neck, as fleible as a
swan's, rises thirty feet above the waves.

Those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity.
They heaved around them liuid mountains, which rolled even to our
raft and rocked it perilously. Twenty times we were near capsiing.
issings of prodigious force are heard. The two beasts are fast
locked together  cannot distinguish the one from the other. The
probable rage of the conueror inspires us with intense fear.

ne hour, two hours, pass away. The struggle continues with unabated
ferocity. The combatants alternately approach and recede from our
raft. We remain motionless, ready to fire. Suddenly the ichthyosaurus
and the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in
the water. Several minutes pass by while the fight goes on under
water.

All at once an enormous head is darted up, the head of the
plesiosaurus. The monster is wounded to death.  no longer see his
scaly armour. nly his long neck shoots up, drops again, coils and
uncoils, droops, lashes the waters like a gigantic whip, and writhes
like a worm that you tread on. The water is splashed for a long way
around. The spray almost blinds us. ut soon the reptile's agony
draws to an end its movements become fainter, its contortions cease
to be so violent, and the long serpentine form lies a lifeless log on
the labouring deep.

As for the ichthyosaurushas he returned to his submarine cavern?
or will he reappear on the surface of the sea?




CATE .

TE GEAT GESE


Wednesday, August .Fortunately the wind blows violently, and
has enabled us to flee from the scene of the late terrible struggle.
ans keeps at his post at the helm. My uncle, whom the absorbing
incidents of the combat had drawn away from his contemplations, began
again to look impatiently around him.

The voyage resumes its uniform tenor, which  don't care to break
with a repetition of such events as yesterday's.

Thursday, Aug. .Wind ..E., unsteady and fitful. Temperature
high. ate three and a half leagues an hour.

About noon a distant noise is heard.  note the fact without being
able to eplain it. t is a continuous roar.

n the distance, says the rofessor, there is a rock or islet,
against which the sea is breaking.

ans climbs up the mast, but sees no breakers. The ocean' is smooth
and unbroken to its farthest limit.

Three hours pass away. The roarings seem to proceed from a very
distant waterfall.

 remark upon this to my uncle, who replies doubtfully: es,  am
convinced that  am right. Are we, then, speeding forward to some
cataract which will cast us down an abyss? This method of getting on
may please the rofessor, because it is vertical but for my part 
prefer the more ordinary modes of horiontal progression.

At any rate, some leagues to the windward there must be some noisy
phenomenon, for now the roarings are heard with increasing loudness.
o they proceed from the sky or the ocean?

 look up to the atmospheric vapours, and try to fathom their depths.
The sky is calm and motionless. The clouds have reached the utmost
limit of the lofty vault, and there lie still bathed in the bright
glare of the electric light. t is not there that we must seek for
the cause of this phenomenon. Then  eamine the horion, which is
unbroken and clear of all mist. There is no change in its aspect. ut
if this noise arises from a fall, a cataract, if all this ocean flows
away headlong into a lower basin yet, if that deafening roar is
produced by a mass of falling water, the current must needs
accelerate, and its increasing speed will give me the measure of the
peril that threatens us.  consult the current: there is none. 
throw an empty bottle into the sea: it lies still.

About four ans rises, lays hold of the mast, climbs to its top.
Thence his eye sweeps a large area of sea, and it is fied upon a
point. is countenance ehibits no surprise, but his eye is immovably
steady.

e sees something, says my uncle.

 believe he does.

ans comes down, then stretches his arm to the south, saying:

ere nere

own there? repeated my uncle.

Then, seiing his glass, he gaes attentively for a minute, which
seems to me an age.

es, yes he cried.  see a vast inverted cone rising from the
surface.

s it another sea beast?

erhaps it is.

Then let us steer farther westward, for we know something of the
danger of coming across monsters of that sort.

et us go straight on, replied my uncle.

 appealed to ans. e maintained his course infleibly.

et, if at our present distance from the animal, a distance of twelve
leagues at the least, the column of water driven through its blowers
may be distinctly seen, it must needs be of vast sie. The commonest
prudence would counsel immediate flight but we did not come so far
to be prudent.

mprudently, therefore, we pursue our way. The nearer we approach,
the higher mounts the et of water. What monster can possibly fill
itself with such a uantity of water, and spurt it up so continuously?

At eight in the evening we are not two leagues distant from it. ts
bodydusky, enormous, hillockylies spread upon the sea like an
islet. s it illusion or fear? ts length seems to me a couple of
thousand yards. What can be this cetacean, which neither Cuvier nor
lumenbach knew anything about? t lies motionless, as if asleep the
sea seems unable to move it in the least it is the waves that
undulate upon its sides. The column of water thrown up to a height of
five hundred feet falls in rain with a deafening uproar. And here are
we scudding like lunatics before the wind, to get near to a monster
that a hundred whales a day would not satisfy

Terror seies upon me.  refuse to go further.  will cut the
halliards if necessary  am in open mutiny against the rofessor,
who vouchsafes no answer.

Suddenly ans rises, and pointing with his finger at the menacing
obect, he says:

olm.

An island cries my uncle.

That's not an island  cried sceptically.

t's nothing else, shouted the rofessor, with a loud laugh.

ut that column of water?

Geyser, said ans.

o doubt it is a geyser, like those in celand.

At first  protest against being so widely mistaken as to have taken
an island for a marine monster. ut the evidence is against me, and 
have to confess my error. t is nothing worse than a natural
phenomenon.

As we approach nearer the dimensions of the liuid column become
magnificent. The islet resembles, with a most deceiving likeness, an
enormous cetacean, whose head dominates the waves at a height of
twenty yards. The geyser, a word meaning 'fury,' rises maestically
from its etremity. eep and heavy eplosions are heard from time to
time, when the enormous et, possessed with more furious violence,
shakes its plumy crest, and springs with a bound till it reaches the
lowest stratum of the clouds. t stands alone. o steam vents, no hot
springs surround it, and all the volcanic power of the region is
concentrated here. Sparks of electric fire mingle with the daling
sheaf of lighted fluid, every drop of which refracts the prismatic
colours.

et us land, said the rofessor.

ut we must carefully avoid this waterspout, which would sink our
raft in a moment.

ans, steering with his usual skill, brought us to the other
etremity of the islet.

 leaped up on the rock my uncle lightly followed, while our hunter
remained at his post, like a man too wise ever to be astonished.

We walked upon granite mingled with siliceous tufa. The soil shivers
and shakes under our feet, like the sides of an overheated boiler
filled with steam struggling to get loose. We come in sight of a
small central basin, out of which the geyser springs.  plunge a
register thermometer into the boiling water. t marks an intense heat
of , which is far above the boiling point therefore this water
issues from an ardent furnace, which is not at all in harmony with
rofessor iedenbrock's theories.  cannot help making the remark.

Well, he replied, how does that make against my doctrine?

h, nothing at all,  said, seeing that  was going in opposition
to immovable obstinacy.

Still  am constrained to confess that hitherto we have been
wonderfully favoured, and that for some reason unknown to myself we
have accomplished our ourney under singularly favourable conditions
of temperature. ut it seems manifest to me that some day we shall
reach a region where the central heat attains its highest limits, and
goes beyond a point that can be registered by our thermometers.

That is what we shall see. So says the rofessor, who, having named
this volcanic islet after his nephew, gives the signal to embark
again.

For some minutes  am still contemplating the geyser.  notice that
it throws up its column of water with variable force: sometimes
sending it to a great height, then again to a lower, which 
attribute to the variable pressure of the steam accumulated in its
reservoir.

At last we leave the island, rounding away past the low rocks on its
southern shore. ans has taken advantage of the halt to refit his
rudder.

ut before going any farther  make a few observations, to calculate
the distance we have gone over, and note them in my ournal. We have
crossed two hundred and seventy leagues of sea since leaving ort
Gruben and we are si hundred and twenty leagues from celand,
under England. 

 This distance carries the travellers as far as under the yrenees
if the league measures three miles. Trans.

A EECTC STM


Friday, August .n the morrow the magnificent geyser has
disappeared. The wind has risen, and has rapidly carried us away from
Ael sland. The roarings become lost in the distance.

The weatherif we may use that termwill change before long. The
atmosphere is charged with vapours, pervaded with the electricity
generated by the evaporation of saline waters. The clouds are sinking
lower, and assume an olive hue. The electric light can scarcely
penetrate through the dense curtain which has dropped over the
theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged.

 feel peculiar sensations, like many creatures on earth at the
approach of violent atmospheric changes. The heavily voluted cumulus
clouds lower gloomily and threateningly they wear that implacable
look which  have sometimes noticed at the outbreak of a great storm.
The air is heavy the sea is calm.

n the distance the clouds resemble great bales of cotton, piled up
in picturesue disorder. y degrees they dilate, and gain in huge
sie what they lose in number. Such is their ponderous weight that
they cannot rise from the horion but, obeying an impulse from
higher currents, their dense consistency slowly yields. The gloom
upon them deepens and they soon present to our view a ponderous mass
of almost level surface. From time to time a fleecy tuft of mist,
with yet some gleaming light left upon it, drops down upon the dense
floor of grey, and loses itself in the opaue and impenetrable mass.

The atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity.
My whole body is saturated my hair bristles ust as when you stand
upon an insulated stool under the action of an electrical machine. t
seems to me as if my companions, the moment they touched me, would
receive a severe shock like that from an electric eel.

At ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated. The
wind never lulls but to acuire increased strength the vast bank of
heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing
storms.

 am loth to believe these atmospheric menaces, and yet  cannot help
muttering:

ere's some very bad weather coming on.

The rofessor made no answer. is temper is awful, to udge from the
working of his features, as he sees this vast length of ocean
unrolling before him to an indefinite etent. e can only spare time
to shrug his shoulders viciously.

There's a heavy storm coming on,  cried, pointing towards the
horion. Those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea.

A deep silence falls on all around. The lately roaring winds are
hushed into a dead calm nature seems to breathe no more, and to be
sinking into the stillness of death. n the mast already  see the
light play of a lambent St. Elmo's fire the outstretched sail
catches not a breath of wind, and hangs like a sheet of lead. The
rudder stands motionless in a sluggish, waveless sea. ut if we have
now ceased to advance why do we yet leave that sail loose, which at
the first shock of the tempest may capsie us in a moment?

et us reef the sail and cut the mast down  cried. That will be
safest.

o, no ever shouted my impetuous uncle. ever et the wind
catch us if it will What  want is to get the least glimpse of rock
or shore, even if our raft should be smashed into shivers

The words were hardly out of his mouth when a sudden change took
place in the southern sky. The piledup vapours condense into water
and the air, put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the
condensation of the mists, rouses itself into a whirlwind. t rushes
on from the farthest recesses of the vast cavern. The darkness
deepens scarcely can  ot down a few hurried notes. The helm makes
a bound. My uncle falls full length  creep close to him. e has
laid a firm hold upon a rope, and appears to watch with grim
satisfaction this awful display of elemental strife.

ans stirs not. is long hair blown by the pelting storm, and laid
flat across his immovable countenance, makes him a strange figure
for the end of each lock of loose flowing hair is tipped with little
luminous radiations. This frightful mask of electric sparks suggests
to me, even in this diy ecitement, a comparison with preadamite
man, the contemporary of the ichthyosaurus and the megatherium. 

 ather of the mammoth and the mastodon. Trans.

The mast yet holds firm. The sail stretches tight like a bubble ready
to burst. The raft flies at a rate that  cannot reckon, but not so
fast as the foaming clouds of spray which it dashes from side to side
in its headlong speed.

The sail the sail  cry, motioning to lower it.

o replies my uncle.

e repeats ans, leisurely shaking his head.

ut now the rain forms a rushing cataract in front of that horion
toward which we are running with such maddening speed. ut before it
has reached us the rain cloud parts asunder, the sea boils, and the
electric fires are brought into violent action by a mighty chemical
power that descends from the higher regions. The most vivid flashes
of lightning are mingled with the violent crash of continuous
thunder. Ceaseless fiery arrows dart in and out amongst the flying
thunderclouds the vaporous mass soon glows with incandescent heat
hailstones rattle fiercely down, and as they dash upon our iron tools
they too emit gleams and flashes of lurid light. The heaving waves
resemble fiery volcanic hills, each belching forth its own interior
flames, and every crest is plumed with dancing fire. My eyes fail
under the daling light, my ears are stunned with the incessant
crash of thunder.  must be bound to the mast, which bows like a reed
before the mighty strength of the storm.

ere my notes become vague and indistinct.  have only been able to
find a few which  seem to have otted down almost unconsciously. ut
their very brevity and their obscurity reveal the intensity of the
ecitement which dominated me, and describe the actual position even
better than my memory could do.

Sunday, .Where are we? riven forward with a swiftness that
cannot be measured.

The night was fearful no abatement of the storm. The din and uproar
are incessant our ears are bleeding to echange a word is
impossible.

The lightning flashes with intense brilliancy, and never seems to
cease for a moment. Zigag streams of bluish white fire dash down
upon the sea and rebound, and then take an upward flight till they
strike the granite vault that overarches our heads. Suppose that
solid roof should crumble down upon our heads ther flashes with
incessant play cross their vivid fires, while others again roll
themselves into balls of living fire which eplode like bombshells,
but the music of which scarcelyadds to the din of the battle strife
that almost deprives us of our senses of hearing and sight the limit
of intense loudness has been passed within which the human ear can
distinguish one sound from another. f all the powder magaines in
the world were to eplode at once, we should hear no more than we do
now.

From the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of
lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their
component molecules the gaseous elements of the air need to be
slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rush upwards
into the air and fall back again in white foam.

Whither are we flying? My uncle lies full length across the raft.

The heat increases.  refer to the thermometer it indicates . . .
the figure is obliterated.

Monday, August .Will there be an end to it? s the atmospheric
condition, having once reached this density, to become final?

We are prostrated and worn out with fatigue. ut ans is as usual.
The raft bears on still to the southeast. We have made two hundred
leagues since we left Ael sland.

At noon the violence of the storm redoubles. We are obliged to secure
as fast as possible every article that belongs to our cargo. Each of
us is lashed to some part of the raft. The waves rise above our heads.

For three days we have never been able to make each other hear a
word. ur mouths open, our lips move, but not a word can be heard. We
cannot even make ourselves heard by approaching our mouth close to
the ear.

My uncle has drawn nearer to me. e has uttered a few words. They
seem to be 'We are lost' but  am not sure.

At last  write down the words: et us lower the sail.

e nods his consent.

Scarcely has he lifted his head again before a ball of fire has
bounded over the waves and lighted on board our raft. Mast and sail
flew up in an instant together, and  saw them carried up to
prodigious height, resembling in appearance a pterodactyle, one of
those strong birds of the infant world.

We lay there, our blood running cold with unspeakable terror. The
fireball, half of it white, half aure blue, and the sie of a
teninch shell, moved slowly about the raft, but revolving on its own
ais with astonishing velocity, as if whipped round by the force of
the whirlwind. ere it comes, there it glides, now it is up the
ragged stump of the mast, thence it lightly leaps on the provision
bag, descends with a light bound, and ust skims the powder magaine.
orrible we shall be blown up but no, the daling disk of
mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches ans, who fies
his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle, who
falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it. And now my turn
comes pale and trembling under the blinding splendour and the
melting heat, it drops at my feet, spinning silently round upon the
deck  try to move my foot away, but cannot.

A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air, it enters the throat,
it fills the lungs. We suffer stifling pains.

Why am  unable to move my foot? s it riveted to the planks? Alas
the fall upon our fated raft of this electric globe has magnetised
every iron article on board. The instruments, the tools, our guns,
are clashing and clanking violently in their collisions with each
other the nails of my boots cling tenaciously to a plate of iron let
into the timbers, and  cannot draw my foot away from the spot. At
last by a violent effort  release myself at the instant when the
ball in its gyrations was about to seie upon it, and carry me off my
feet ....

Ah what a flood of intense and daling light the globe has burst,
and we are deluged with tongues of fire

ere  end what  may call my log, happily saved from the wreck, and
 resume my narrative as before.

What happened when the raft was dashed upon the rocks is more than 
can tell.  felt myself hurled into the waves and if  escaped from
death, and if my body was not torn over the sharp edges of the rocks,
it was because the powerful arm of ans came to my rescue.

The brave celander carried me out of the reach of the waves, over a
burning sand where  found myself by the side of my uncle.

Then he returned to the rocks, against which the furious waves were
beating, to save what he could.  was unable to speak.  was
shattered with fatigue and ecitement  wanted a whole hour to
recover even a little.

ut a deluge of rain was still falling, though with that violence
which generally denotes the near cessation of a storm. A few
overhanging rocks afforded us some shelter from the storm. ans
prepared some food, which  could not touch and each of us,
ehausted with three sleepless nights, fell into a broken and painful
sleep.

The net day the weather was splendid. The sky and the sea had sunk
into sudden repose. Every trace of the awful storm had disappeared.
The ehilarating voice of the rofessor fell upon my ears as  awoke
he was ominously cheerful.

Well, my boy, he cried, have you slept well?

Would not any one have thought that we were still in our cheerful
little house on the nigstrasse and that  was only ust coming down
to breakfast, and that  was to be married to Gruben that day?

Alas if the tempest had but sent the raft a little more east, we
should have passed under Germany, under my beloved town of amburg,
under the very street where dwelt all that  loved most in the world.
Then only forty leagues would have separated us ut they were forty
leagues perpendicular of solid granite wall, and in reality we were a
thousand leagues asunder

All these painful reflections rapidly crossed my mind before  could
answer my uncle's uestion.

Well, now, he repeated, won't you tell me how you have slept?

h, very well,  said.  am only a little knocked up, but  shall
soon be better.

h, says my uncle, that's nothing to signify. ou are only a
little bit tired.

ut you, uncle, you seem in very good spirits this morning.

elighted, my boy, delighted. We have got there.

To our ourney's end?

o but we have got to the end of that endless sea. ow we shall go
by land, and really begin to go down down down

ut, my dear uncle, do let me ask you one uestion.

f course, Ael.

ow about returning?

eturning? Why, you are talking about the return before the arrival.

o,  only want to know how that is to be managed.

n the simplest way possible. When we have reached the centre of the
globe, either we shall find some new way to get back, or we shall
come back like decent folks the way we came.  feel pleased at the
thought that it is sure not to be shut against us.

ut then we shall have to refit the raft.

f course.

Then, as to provisions, have we enough to last?

es to be sure we have. ans is a clever fellow, and  am sure he
must have saved a large part of our cargo. ut still let us go and
make sure.

We left this grotto which lay open to every wind. At the same time 
cherished a trembling hope which was a fear as well. t seemed to me
impossible that the terrible wreck of the raft should not have
destroyed everything on board. n my arrival on the shore  found
ans surrounded by an assemblage of articles all arranged in good
order. My uncle shook hands with him with a lively gratitude. This
man, with almost superhuman devotion, had been at work all the while
that we were asleep, and had saved the most precious of the articles
at the risk of his life.

ot that we had suffered no losses. For instance, our firearms but
we might do without them. ur stock of powder had remained uninured
after having risked blowing up during the storm.

Well, cried the rofessor, as we have no guns we cannot hunt,
that's all.

es, but how about the instruments?

ere is the aneroid, the most useful of all, and for which  would
have given all the others. y means of it  can calculate the depth
and know when we have reached the centre without it we might very
likely go beyond, and come out at the antipodes

Such high spirits as these were rather too strong.

ut where is the compass?  asked.

ere it is, upon this rock, in perfect condition, as well as the
thermometers and the chronometer. The hunter is a splendid fellow.

There was no denying it. We had all our instruments. As for tools and
appliances, there they all lay on the groundladders, ropes, picks,
spades, etc.

Still there was the uestion of provisions to be settled, and 
askedow are we off for provisions?

The boes containing these were in a line upon the shore, in a
perfect state of preservation for the most part the sea had spared
them, and what with biscuits, salt meat, spirits, and salt fish, we
might reckon on four months' supply.

Four months cried the rofessor. We have time to go and to
return and with what is left  will give a grand dinner to my
friends at the ohannum.

 ought by this time to have been uite accustomed to my uncle's
ways yet there was always something fresh about him to astonish me.

ow, said he, we will replenish our supply of water with the rain
which the storm has left in all these granite basins therefore we
shall have no reason to fear anything from thirst. As for the raft, 
will recommend ans to do his best to repair it, although  don't
epect it will be of any further use to us.

ow so?  cried.

An idea of my own, my lad.  don't think we shall come out by the
way that we went in.

 stared at the rofessor with a good deal of mistrust.  asked, was
he not touched in the brain? And yet there was method in his madness.

And now let us go to breakfast, said he.

 followed him to a headland, after he had given his instructions to
the hunter. There preserved meat, biscuit, and tea made us an
ecellent meal, one of the best  ever remember. unger, the fresh
air, the calm uiet weather, after the commotions we had gone
through, all contributed to give me a good appetite.

Whilst breakfasting  took the opportunity to put to my uncle the
uestion where we were now.

That seems to me,  said, rather difficult to make out.

es, it is difficult, he said, to calculate eactly perhaps even
impossible, since during these three stormy days  have been unable
to keep any account of the rate or direction of the raft but still
we may get an approimation.

The last observation,  remarked, was made on the island, when the
geyser was

ou mean Ael sland. on't decline the honour of having given your
name to the first island ever discovered in the central parts of the
globe.

Well, said , let it be Ael sland. Then we had cleared two
hundred and seventy leagues of sea, and we were si hundred leagues
from celand.

ery well, answered my uncle let us start from that point and
count four days' storm, during which our rate cannot have been less
than eighty leagues in the twentyfour hours.

That is right and this would make three hundred leagues more.

es, and the iedenbrock sea would be si hundred leagues from shore
to shore. Surely, Ael, it may vie in sie with the Mediterranean
itself.

Especially,  replied, if it happens that we have only crossed it
in its narrowest part. And it is a curious circumstance,  added,
that if my computations are right, and we are nine hundred leagues
from ekiavik, we have now the Mediterranean above our head.

That is a good long way, my friend. ut whether we are under Turkey
or the Atlantic depends very much upon the uestion in what direction
we have been moving. erhaps we have deviated.

o,  think not. ur course has been the same all along, and 
believe this shore is southeast of ort Gruben.

Well, replied my uncle, we may easily ascertain this by consulting
the compass. et us go and see what it says.

The rofessor moved towards the rock upon which ans had laid down
the instruments. e was gay and full of spirits he rubbed his hands,
he studied his attitudes.  followed him, curious to know if  was
right in my estimate. As soon as we had arrived at the rock my uncle
took the compass, laid it horiontally, and uestioned the needle,
which, after a few oscillations, presently assumed a fied position.
My uncle looked, and looked, and looked again. e rubbed his eyes,
and then turned to me thunderstruck with some unepected discovery.

What is the matter?  asked.

e motioned to me to look. An eclamation of astonishment burst from
me. The north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be
the south. t pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea 
shook the bo, eamined it again, it was in perfect condition. n
whatever position  placed the bo the needle pertinaciously returned
to this unepected uarter. Therefore there seemed no reason to doubt
that during the storm there had been a sudden change of wind
unperceived by us, which had brought our raft back to the shore which
we thought we had left so long a distance behind us.

ever had  seen the man so put out of countenance and so disturbed.
The fatigues of our passage across, the dangers met, had all to be
begun over again. We had gone backwards instead of forwards

ut my uncle rapidly recovered himself.

Aha will fate play tricks upon me? Will the elements lay plots
against me? Shall fire, air, and water make a combined attack against
me? Well, they shall know what a determined man can do.  will not
yield.  will not stir a single foot backwards, and it will be seen
whether man or nature is to have the upper hand

Erect upon the rock, angry and threatening, tto iedenbrock was a
rather grotesue fierce parody upon the fierce Achilles defying the
lightning. ut  thought it my duty to interpose and attempt to lay
some restraint upon this unmeasured fanaticism.

ust listen to me,  said firmly. Ambition must have a limit
somewhere we cannot perform impossibilities we are not at all fit
for another sea voyage who would dream of undertaking a voyage of
five hundred leagues upon a heap of rotten planks, with a blanket in
rags for a sail, a stick for a mast, and fierce winds in our teeth?
We cannot steer we shall be buffeted by the tempests, and we should
be fools and madmen to attempt to cross a second time.

 was able to develop this series of unanswerable reasons for ten
minutes without interruption not that the rofessor was paying any
respectful attention to his nephew's arguments, but because he was
deaf to all my elouence.

To the raft he shouted.

Such was his only reply. t was no use for me to entreat, supplicate,
get angry, or do anything else in the way of opposition it would
only have been opposing a will harder than the granite rock.

ans was finishing the repairs of the raft. ne would have thought
that this strange being was guessing at my uncle's intentions. With a
few more pieces of surturbrand he had refitted our vessel. A sail
already hung from the new mast, and the wind was playing in its
waving folds.

The rofessor said a few words to the guide, and immediately he put
everything on board and arranged every necessary for our departure.
The air was clearand the northwest wind blew steadily.

What could  do? Could  stand against the two? t was impossible? f
ans had but taken my side ut no, it was not to be. The celander
seemed to have renounced all will of his own and made a vow to forget
and deny himself.  could get nothing out of a servant so feudalised,
as it were, to his master. My only course was to proceed.

 was therefore going with as much resignation as  could find to
resume my accustomed place on the raft, when my uncle laid his hand
upon my shoulder.

We shall not sail until tomorrow, he said.

 made a movement intended to epress resignation.

 must neglect nothing, he said and since my fate has driven me
on this part of the coast,  will not leave it until  have eamined
it.

To understand what followed, it must be borne in mind that, through
circumstances hereafter to be eplained, we were not really where the
rofessor supposed we were. n fact we were not upon the north shore
of the sea.

ow let us start upon fresh discoveries,  said.

And leaving ans to his work we started off together. The space
between the water and the foot of the cliffs was considerable. t
took half an hour to bring us to the wall of rock. We trampled under
our feet numberless shells of all the forms and sies which eisted
in the earliest ages of the world.  also saw immense carapaces more
than fifteen feet in diameter. They had been the coverings of those
gigantic glyptodons or armadilloes of the pleiocene period, of which
the modern tortoise is but a miniature representative.  The soil
was besides this scattered with stony fragments, boulders rounded by
water action, and ridged up in successive lines.  was therefore led
to the conclusion that at one time the sea must have covered the
ground on which we were treading. n the loose and scattered rocks,
now out of the reach of the highest tides, the waves had left
manifest traces of their power to wear their way in the hardest stone.

This might up to a certain point eplain the eistence of an ocean
forty leagues beneath the surface of the globe. ut in my opinion
this liuid mass would be lost by degrees farther and farther within
the interior of the earth, and it certainly had its origin in the
waters of the ocean overhead, which had made their way hither through
some fissure. et it must be believed that that fissure is now
closed, and that all this cavern or immense reservoir was filled in a
very short time. erhaps even this water, subected to the fierce
action of central heat, had partly been resolved into vapour. This
would eplain the eistence of those clouds suspended over our heads
and the development of that electricity which raised such tempests
within the bowels of the earth.

This theory of the phenomena we had witnessed seemed satisfactory to
me for however great and stupendous the phenomena of nature, fied
physical laws will or may always eplain them.

We were therefore walking upon sedimentary soil, the deposits of the
waters of former ages. The rofessor was carefully eamining every
little fissure in the rocks. Wherever he saw a hole he always wanted
to know the depth of it. To him this was important.

We had traversed the shores of the iedenbrock sea for a mile when we
observed a sudden change in the appearance of the soil. t seemed
upset, contorted, and convulsed by a violent upheaval of the lower
strata. n many places depressions or elevations gave witness to some
tremendous power effecting the dislocation of strata.

 The glyptodon and armadillo are mammalian the tortoise is a
chelonian, a reptile, distinct classes of the animal kingdom
therefore the latter cannot be a representative of the former.
Trans.

We moved with difficulty across these granite fissures and chasms
mingled with sile, crystals of uart, and alluvial deposits, when a
field, nay, more than a field, a vast plain, of bleached bones lay
spread before us. t seemed like an immense cemetery, where the
remains of twenty ages mingled their dust together. uge mounds of
bony fragments rose stage after stage in the distance. They undulated
away to the limits of the horion, and melted in the distance in a
faint hae. There within three suare miles were accumulated the
materials for a complete history of the animal life of ages, a
history scarcely outlined in the too recent strata of the inhabited
world.

ut an impatient curiosity impelled our steps crackling and
rattling, our feet were trampling on the remains of prehistoric
animals and interesting fossils, the possession of which is a matter
of rivalry and contention between the museums of great cities. A
thousand Cuviers could never have reconstructed the organic remains
deposited in this magnificent and unparalleled collection.

mericotheria, lophiodia, anoplotheria, megatheria, mastodons,

enthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the
famous Aleandrian library burnt by mar and restored by a miracle
from its ashes ust such a craed enthusiast was my uncle, rofessor
iedenbrock.

To understand this apostrophe of my uncle's, made to absent French
savants, it will be necessary to allude to an event of high
importance in a palontological point of view, which had occurred a
little while before our departure.

n the th of March, , some ecavators working under the
direction of M. oucher de erthes, in the stone uarries of Moulin
uignon, near Abbeville, in the department of Somme, found a human
awbone fourteen feet beneath the surface. t was the first fossil of
this nature that had ever been brought to light. ot far distant were
found stone hatchets and flint arrowheads stained and encased by
lapse of time with a uniform coat of rust.

The noise of this discovery was very great, not in France alone, but in
England and in Germany. Several savants of the French nstitute, and
amongst them MM. MilneEdwards and de uatrefages, saw at once the
importance of this discovery, proved to demonstration the genuineness of
the bone in uestion, and became the most ardent defendants in what the
English called this 'trial of a awbone.' To the geologists of the
nited ingdom, who believed in the certainty of the factMessrs.
Falconer, usk, Carpenter, and othersscientific Germans were soon
oined, and amongst them the forwardest, the most fiery, and the most
enthusiastic, was my uncle iedenbrock.

Therefore the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the uaternary
period seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted.

t is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent in M.
Elie de eaumont. This high authority maintained that the soil of
Moulin uignon was not diluvial at all, but was of much more recent
formation and, agreeing in that with Cuvier, he refused to admit
that the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the
uaternary period. My uncle iedenbrock, along with the great body of
the geologists, had maintained his ground, disputed, and argued,
until M. Elie de eaumont stood almost alone in his opinion.

We knew all these details, but we were not aware that since our
departure the uestion had advanced to farther stages. ther similar
maillaries, though belonging to individuals of various types and
different nations, were found in the loose grey soil of certain
grottoes in France, Switerland, and elgium, as well as weapons,
tools, earthen utensils, bones of children and adults. The eistence
therefore of man in the uaternary period seemed to become daily more
certain.

or was this all. Fresh discoveries of remains in the pleiocene
formation had emboldened other geologists to refer back the human
species to a higher antiuity still. t is true that these remains
were not human bones, but obects bearing the traces of his
handiwork, such as fossil legbones of animals, sculptured and carved
evidently by the hand of man.

Thus, at one bound, the record of the eistence of man receded far
back into the history of the ages past he was a predecessor of the
mastodon he was a contemporary of the southern elephant he lived a
hundred thousand years ago, when, according to geologists, the
pleiocene formation was in progress.

Such then was the state of palontological science, and what we knew
of it was sufficient to eplain our behaviour in the presence of this
stupendous Golgotha. Any one may now understand the frenied
ecitement of my uncle, when, twenty yards farther on, he found
himself face to face with a primitive man

t was a perfectly recognisable human body. ad some particular soil,
like that of the cemetery St. Michel, at ordeau, preserved it thus
for so many ages? t might be so. ut this dried corpse, with its
parchmentlike skin drawn tightly over the bony frame, the limbs
still preserving their shape, sound teeth, abundant hair, and finger
and toe nails of frightful length, this desiccated mummy startled us
by appearing ust as it had lived countless ages ago.  stood mute
before this apparition of remote antiuity. My uncle, usually so
garrulous, was struck dumb likewise. We raised the body. We stood it
up against a rock. t seemed to stare at us out of its empty orbits.
We sounded with our knuckles his hollow frame.

After some moments' silence the rofessor was himself again. tto
iedenbrock, yielding to his nature, forgot all the circumstances of
our eventful ourney, forgot where we were standing, forgot the
vaulted cavern which contained us. o doubt he was in mind back again
in his ohannum, holding forth to his pupils, for he assumed his
learned air and addressing himself to an imaginary audience, he
proceeded thus:

Gentlemen,  have the honour to introduce to you a man of the
uaternary or posttertiary system. Eminent geologists have denied
his eistence, others no less eminent have affirmed it. The St.
Thomases of palontology, if they were here, might now touch him with
their fingers, and would be obliged to acknowledge their error.  am
uite aware that science has to be on its guard with discoveries of
this kind.  know what capital enterprising individuals like arnum
have made out of fossil men.  have heard the tale of the kneepan of
Aa, the pretended body of restes claimed to have been found by the
Spartans, and of the body of Asterius, ten cubits long, of which
ausanias speaks.  have read the reports of the skeleton of Trapani,
found in the fourteenth century, and which was at the time identified
as that of olyphemus and the history of the giant unearthed in the
siteenth century near alermo. ou know as well as  do, gentlemen,
the analysis made at ucerne in  of those huge bones which the
celebrated r. Feli later affirmed to be those of a giant nineteen
feet high.  have gone through the treatises of Cassanion, and all
those memoirs, pamphlets, answers, and reoinders published
respecting the skeleton of Teutobochus, the invader of Gaul, dug out
of a sandpit in the auphin, in . n the eighteenth century 
would have stood up for Scheucher's preadamite man against eter
Campet.  have perused a writing, entitled Gigan

ere my uncle's unfortunate infirmity met himthat of being unable
in public to pronounce hard words.

The pamphlet entitled Gigan

e could get no further.

Giganteo

t was not to be done. The unlucky word would not come out. At the
ohannum there would have been a laugh.

Gigantosteologie, at last the rofessor burst out, between two
words which  shall not record here.

Then rushing on with renewed vigour, and with great animation:

es, gentlemen,  know all these things, and more.  know that
Cuvier and lumenbach have recognised in these bones nothing more
remarkable than the bones of the mammoth and other mammals of the
posttertiary period. ut in the presence of this specimen to doubt
would be to insult science. There stands the body ou may see it,
touch it. t is not a mere skeleton it is an entire body, preserved
for a purely anthropological end and purpose.

 was good enough not to contradict this startling assertion.

f  could only wash it in a solution of sulphuric acid, pursued my
uncle,  should be able to clear it from all the earthy particles
and the shells which are incrusted about it. ut  do not possess
that valuable solvent. et, such as it is, the body shall tell us its
own wonderful story.

ere the rofessor laid hold of the fossil skeleton, and handled it
with the skill of a deterous showman.

ou see, he said, that it is not si feet long, and that we are
still separated by a long interval from the pretended race of giants.
As for the family to which it belongs, it is evidently Caucasian. t
is the white race, our own. The skull of this fossil is a regular
oval, or rather ovoid. t ehibits no prominent cheekbones, no
proecting aws. t presents no appearance of that prognathism which
diminishes the facial angle.  Measure that angle. t is nearly
ninety degrees. ut  will go further in my deductions, and  will
affirm that this specimen of the human family is of the aphetic
race, which has since spread from the ndies to the Atlantic. on't
smile, gentlemen.

obody was smiling but the learned rofessor was freuently
disturbed by the broad smiles provoked by his learned eccentricities.

es, he pursued with animation, this is a fossil man, the
contemporary of the mastodons whose remains fill this amphitheatre.
ut if you ask me how he came there, how those strata on which he lay
slipped down into this enormous hollow in the globe,  confess 
cannot answer that uestion. o doubt in the posttertiary period
considerable commotions were still disturbing the crust of the earth.
The longcontinued cooling of the globe produced chasms, fissures,
clefts, and faults, into which, very probably, portions of the upper
earth may have fallen.  make no rash assertions but there is the
man surrounded by his own works, by hatchets, by flint arrowheads,
which are the characteristics of the stone age. And unless he came
here, like myself, as a tourist on a visit and as a pioneer of
science,  can entertain no doubt of the authenticity of his remote
origin.

 The facial angle is formed by two lines, one touching the brow
and the front teeth, the other from the orifice of the ear to the
lower line of the nostrils. The greater this angle, the higher
intelligence denoted by the formation of the skull. rognathism is
that proection of the awbones which sharpens or lessons this
angle, and which is illustrated in the negro countenance and in the
lowest savages.

The rofessor ceased to speak, and the audience broke out into loud
and unanimous applause. For of course my uncle was right, and wiser
men than his nephew would have had some trouble to refute his
statements.

Another remarkable thing. This fossil body was not the only one in
this immense catacomb. We came upon other bodies at every step
amongst this mortal dust, and my uncle might select the most curious
of these specimens to demolish the incredulity of sceptics.

n fact it was a wonderful spectacle, that of these generations of
men and animals commingled in a common cemetery. Then one very
serious uestion arose presently which we scarcely dared to suggest.
ad all those creatures slided through a great fissure in the crust
of the earth, down to the shores of the iedenbrock sea, when they
were dead and turning to dust, or had they lived and grown and died
here in this subterranean world under a false sky, ust like
inhabitants of the upper earth? ntil the present time we had seen
alive only marine monsters and fishes. Might not some living man,
some native of the abyss, be yet a wanderer below on this desert
strand?

For another half hour we trod upon a pavement of bones. We pushed on,
impelled by our burning curiosity. What other marvels did this cavern
contain? What new treasures lay here for science to unfold?  was
prepared for any surprise, my imagination was ready for any
astonishment however astounding.

We had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones.
The rash rofessor, careless of losing his way, hurried me forward.
We advanced in silence, bathed in luminous electric fluid. y some
phenomenon which  am unable to eplain, it lighted up all sides of
every obect eually. Such was its diffusiveness, there being no
central point from which the light emanated, that shadows no longer
eisted. ou might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical
sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer. o
vapour was visible. The rocks, the distant mountains, a few isolated
clumps of forest trees in the distance, presented a weird and
wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal
diffusion of light. We were like offmann's shadowless man.

After walking a mile we reached the outskirts of a vast forest, but
not one of those forests of fungi which bordered ort Gruben.

ere was the vegetation of the tertiary period in its fullest blae
of magnificence. Tall palms, belonging to species no longer living,
splendid palmacites, firs, yews, cypress trees, thuas,
representatives of the conifers, were linked together by a tangled
network of long climbing plants. A soft carpet of moss and hepaticas
luuriously clothed the soil. A few sparkling streams ran almost in
silence under what would have been the shade of the trees, but that
there was no shadow. n their banks grew treeferns similar to those
we grow in hothouses. ut a remarkable feature was the total absence
of colour in all those trees, shrubs, and plants, growing without the
lifegiving heat and light of the sun. Everything seemed miedup and
confounded in one uniform silver grey or light brown tint like that
of fading and faded leaves. ot a green leaf anywhere, and the
flowerswhich were abundant enough in the tertiary period, which
first gave birth to flowerslooked like brownpaper flowers,
without colour or scent.

My uncle iedenbrock ventured to penetrate under this colossal grove.
 followed him, not without fear. Since nature had here provided
vegetable nourishment, why should not the terrible mammals be there
too?  perceived in the broad clearings left by fallen trees, decayed
with age, leguminose plants, acerine, rubice and many other eatable
shrubs, dear to ruminant animals at every period. Then  observed,
mingled together in confusion, trees of countries far apart on the
surface of the globe. The oak and the palm were growing side by side,
the Australian eucalyptus leaned against the orwegian pine, the
birchtree of the north mingled its foliage with ew Zealand kauris.
t was enough to distract the most ingenious classifier of
terrestrial botany.

Suddenly  halted.  drew back my uncle.

The diffused light revealed the smallest obect in the dense and
distant thickets.  had thought  sawno  did see, with my own
eyes, vast colossal forms moving amongst the trees. They were
gigantic animals it was a herd of mastodonsnot fossil remains,
but living and resembling those the bones of which were found in the
marshes of hio in .  saw those huge elephants whose long,
fleible trunks were grouting and turning up the soil under the trees
like a legion of serpents.  could hear the crashing noise of their
long ivory tusks boring into the old decaying trunks. The boughs
cracked, and the leaves torn away by cartloads went down the
cavernous throats of the vast brutes.

So, then, the dream in which  had had a vision of the prehistoric
world, of the tertiary and posttertiary periods, was now realised.
And there we were alone, in the bowels of the earth, at the mercy of
its wild inhabitants

My uncle was gaing with intense and eager interest.

Come on said he, seiing my arm. Forward forward

o,  will not  cried. We have no firearms. What could we do in the
midst of a herd of these fourfooted giants? Come away, unclecome o
human being may with safety dare the anger of these monstrous beasts.

o human creature? replied my uncle in a lower voice. ou are
wrong, Ael. ook, look down there  fancy  see a living creature
similar to ourselves: it is a man

 looked, shaking my head incredulously. ut though at first  was
unbelieving  had to yield to the evidence of my senses.

n fact, at a distance of a uarter of a mile, leaning against the
trunk of a gigantic kauri, stood a human being, the roteus of those
subterranean regions, a new son of eptune, watching this countless
herd of mastodons.

mmanis pecoris custos, immanior ipse. 

 The shepherd of gigantic herds, and huger still himself.

es, truly, huger still himself. t was no longer a fossil being like
him whose dried remains we had easily lifted up in the field of
bones it was a giant, able to control those monsters. n stature he
was at least twelve feet high. is head, huge and unshapely as a
buffalo's, was half hidden in the thick and tangled growth of his
unkempt hair. t most resembled the mane of the primitive elephant.
n his hand he wielded with ease an enormous bough, a staff worthy of
this shepherd of the geologic period.

We stood petrified and speechless with amaement. ut he might see
us We must fly

Come, do come  said to my uncle, who for once allowed himself to
be persuaded.

n another uarter of an hour our nimble heels had carried us beyond
the reach of this horrible monster.

And yet, now that  can reflect uietly, now that my spirit has grown
calm again, now that months have slipped by since this strange and
supernatural meeting, what am  to think? what am  to believe? 
must conclude that it was impossible that our senses had been
deceived, that our eyes did not see what we supposed they saw. o
human being lives in this subterranean world no generation of men
dwells in those inferior caverns of the globe, unknown to and
unconnected with the inhabitants of its surface. t is absurd to
believe it

 had rather admit that it may have been some animal whose structure
resembled the human, some ape or baboon of the early geological ages,
some protopitheca, or some mesopitheca, some early or middle ape like
that discovered by Mr. artet in the bone cave of Sansau. ut this
creature surpassed in stature all the measurements known in modern
palontology. ut that a man, a living man, and therefore whole
generations doubtless besides, should be buried there in the bowels
of the earth, is impossible.

owever, we had left behind us the luminous forest, dumb with
astonishment, overwhelmed and struck down with a terror which
amounted to stupefaction. We kept running on for fear the horrible
monster might be on our track. t was a flight, a fall, like that
fearful pulling and dragging which is peculiar to nightmare.
nstinctively we got back to the iedenbrock sea, and  cannot say
into what vagaries my mind would not have carried me but for a
circumstance which brought me back to practical matters.

Although  was certain that we were now treading upon a soil not
hitherto touched by our feet,  often perceived groups of rocks which
reminded me of those about ort Gruben. esides, this seemed to
confirm the indications of the needle, and to show that we had
against our will returned to the north of the iedenbrock sea.
ccasionally we felt uite convinced. rooks and waterfalls were
tumbling everywhere from the proections in the rocks.  thought 
recognised the bed of surturbrand, our faithful ansbach, and the
grotto in which  had recovered life and consciousness. Then a few
paces farther on, the arrangement of the cliffs, the appearance of an
unrecognised stream, or the strange outline of a rock, came to throw
me again into doubt.

 communicated my doubts to my uncle. ike myself, he hesitated he
could recognise nothing again amidst this monotonous scene.

Evidently, said , we have not landed again at our original
starting point, but the storm has carried us a little higher, and if
we follow the shore we shall find ort Gruben.

f that is the case it will be useless to continue our eploration,
and we had better return to our raft. ut, Ael, are you not
mistaken?

t is difficult to speak decidedly, uncle, for all these rocks are
so very much alike. et  think  recognise the promontory at the
foot of which ans constructed our launch. We must be very near the
little port, if indeed this is not it,  added, eamining a creek
which  thought  recognised.

o, Ael, we should at least find our own traces and  see nothing

ut  do see,  cried, darting upon an obect lying on the sand.

And  showed my uncle a rusty dagger which  had ust picked up.

Come, said he, had you this weapon with you?

 o, certainly ut you, perhaps

ot that  am aware, said the rofessor.  have never had this
obect in my possession.

Well, this is strange

o, Ael, it is very simple. The celanders often wear arms of this
kind. This must have belonged to ans, and he has lost it.

 shook my head. ans had never had an obect like this in his
possession.

id it not belong to some preadamite warrior?  cried, to some
living man, contemporary with the huge cattledriver? ut no. This is
not a relic of the stone age. t is not even of the iron age. This
blade is steel

My uncle stopped me abruptly on my way to a dissertation which would
have taken me a long way, and said coolly:

e calm, Ael, and reasonable. This dagger belongs to the siteenth
century it is a poniard, such as gentlemen carried in their belts to
give the coup de grace. ts origin is Spanish. t was never either
yours, or mine, or the hunter's, nor did it belong to any of those
human beings who may or may not inhabit this inner world. See, it was
never agged like this by cutting men's throats its blade is coated
with a rust neither a day, nor a year, nor a hundred years old.

The rofessor was getting ecited according to his wont, and was
allowing his imagination to run away with him.

Ael, we are on the way towards the grand discovery. This blade has
been left on the strand for from one to three hundred years, and has
blunted its edge upon the rocks that fringe this subterranean sea

ut it has not come alone. t has not twisted itself out of shape
some one has been here before us

esa man has.

And who was that man?

A man who has engraved his name somewhere with that dagger. That man
wanted once more to mark the way to the centre of the earth. et us
look about: look about

And, wonderfully interested, we peered all along the high wall,
peeping into every fissure which might open out into a gallery.

And so we arrived at a place where the shore was much narrowed. ere
the sea came to lap the foot of the steep cliff, leaving a passage no
wider than a couple of yards. etween two boldly proecting rocks
appeared the mouth of a dark tunnel.

There, upon a granite slab, appeared two mysterious graven letters,
half eaten away by time. They were the initials of the bold and
daring traveller:

unic initials appear here

A. S., shouted my uncle. Arne Saknussemm Arne Saknussemm

EAATS F ASTG A ASSAGE T TE CETE F TE EAT


Since the start upon this marvellous pilgrimage  had been through so
many astonishments that  might well be ecused for thinking myself
well hardened against any further surprise. et at the sight of these
two letters, engraved on this spot three hundred years ago,  stood
aghast in dumb amaement. ot only were the initials of the learned
alchemist visible upon the living rock, but there lay the iron point
with which the letters had been engraved.  could no longer doubt of
the eistence of that wonderful traveller and of the fact of his
unparalleled ourney, without the most glaring incredulity.

Whilst these reflections were occupying me, rofessor iedenbrock had
launched into a somewhat rhapsodical eulogium, of which Arne
Saknussemm was, of course, the hero.

Thou marvellous genius he cried, thou hast not forgotten one
indication which might serve to lay open to mortals the road through
the terrestrial crust and thy fellowcreatures may even now, after
the lapse of three centuries, again trace thy footsteps through these
deep and darksome ways. ou reserved the contemplation of these
wonders for other eyes besides your own. our name, graven from stage
to stage, leads the bold follower of your footsteps to the very
centre of our planet's core, and there again we shall find your own
name written with your own hand.  too will inscribe my name upon
this dark granite page. ut for ever henceforth let this cape that
advances into the sea discovered by yourself be known by your own
illustrious nameCape Saknussemm.

Such were the glowing words of panegyric which fell upon my attentive
ear, and  could not resist the sentiment of enthusiasm with which 
too was infected. The fire of eal kindled afresh in me.  forgot
everything.  dismissed from my mind the past perils of the ourney,
the future danger of our return. That which another had done 
supposed we might also do, and nothing that was not superhuman
appeared impossible to me.

Forward forward  cried.

et us first return to ans, he said, and bring the raft to this
spot.

 obeyed, not without dissatisfaction, and passed out rapidly among
the rocks on the shore.

 said: ncle, do you know it seems to me that circumstances have
wonderfully befriended us hitherto?

ou think so, Ael?

o doubt even the tempest has put us on the right way. lessings on
that storm t has brought us back to this coast from which fine
weather would have carried us far away. Suppose we had touched with
our prow the prow of a rudder the southern shore of the
iedenbrock sea, what would have become of us? We should never have
seen the name of Saknussemm, and we should at this moment be
imprisoned on a rockbound, impassable coast.

es, Ael, it is providential that whilst supposing we were steering
south we should have ust got back north at Cape Saknussemm.  must
say that this is astonishing, and that  feel  have no way to
eplain it.

What does that signify, uncle? ur business is not to eplain facts,
but to use them

Certainly but

Well, uncle, we are going to resume the northern route, and to pass
under the north countries of Europeunder Sweden, ussia, Siberia:
who knows where?instead of burrowing under the deserts of Africa,
or perhaps the waves of the Atlantic and that is all  want to know.

es, Ael, you are right. t is all for the best, since we have left
that weary, horiontal sea, which led us nowhere. ow we shall go
down, down, down o you know that it is now only , leagues to
the centre of the globe?

s that all?  cried. Why, that's nothing. et us start: march

All this cray talk was going on still when we met the hunter.
Everything was made ready for our instant departure. Every bit of
cordage was put on board. We took our places, and with our sail set,
ans steered us along the coast to Cape Saknussemm.

The wind was unfavourable to a species of launch not calculated for
shallow water. n many places we were obliged to push ourselves along
with ironpointed sticks. ften the sunken rocks ust beneath the
surface obliged us to deviate from our straight course. At last,
after three hours' sailing, about si in the evening we reached a
place suitable for our landing.  umped ashore, followed by my uncle
and the celander. This short passage had not served to cool my
ardour. n the contrary,  even proposed to burn 'our ship,' to
prevent the possibility of return but my uncle would not consent to
that.  thought him singularly lukewarm.

At least,  said, don't let us lose a minute.

es, yes, lad, he replied but first let us eamine this new
gallery, to see if we shall reuire our ladders.

My uncle put his uhmkorff's apparatus in action the raft moored to
the shore was left alone the mouth of the tunnel was not twenty
yards from us and our party, with myself at the head, made for it
without a moment's delay.

The aperture, which was almost round, was about five feet in
diameter the dark passage was cut out in the live rock and lined
with a coat of the eruptive matter which formerly issued from it the
interior was level with the ground outside, so that we were able to
enter without difficulty. We were following a horiontal plane, when,
only si paces in, our progress was interrupted by an enormous block
ust across our way.

Accursed rock  cried in a passion, finding myself suddenly
confronted by an impassable obstacle.

ight and left we searched in vain for a way, up and down, side to
side there was no getting any farther.  felt fearfully
disappointed, and  would not admit that the obstacle was final. 
stopped,  looked underneath the block: no opening. Above: granite
still. ans passed his lamp over every portion of the barrier in
vain. We must give up all hope of passing it.

 sat down in despair. My uncle strode from side to side in the
narrow passage.

ut how was it with Saknussemm?  cried.

es, said my uncle, was he stopped by this stone barrier?

o, no,  replied with animation. This fragment of rock has been
shaken down by some shock or convulsion, or by one of those magnetic
storms which agitate these regions, and has blocked up the passage
which lay open to him. Many years have elapsed since the return of
Saknussemm to the surface and the fall of this huge fragment. s it
not evident that this gallery was once the way open to the course of
the lava, and that at that time there must have been a free passage?
See here are recent fissures grooving and channelling the granite
roof. This roof itself is formed of fragments of rock carried down,
of enormous stones, as if by some giant's hand but at one time the
epulsive force was greater than usual, and this block, like the
falling keystone of a ruined arch, has slipped down to the ground and
blocked up the way. t is only an accidental obstruction, not met by
Saknussemm, and if we don't destroy it we shall be unworthy to reach
the centre of the earth.

Such was my sentence The soul of the rofessor had passed into me.
The genius of discovery possessed me wholly.  forgot the past, 
scorned the future.  gave not a thought to the things of the surface
of this globe into which  had dived its cities and its sunny
plains, amburg and the nigstrasse, even poor Gruben, who must
have given us up for lost, all were for the time dismissed from the
pages of my memory.

Well, cried my uncle, let us make a way with our pickaes.

Too hard for the pickae.

Well, then, the spade.

That would take us too long.

What, then?

Why gunpowder, to be sure et us mine the obstacle and blow it up.

h, yes, it is only a bit of rock to blast

ans, to work cried my uncle.

The celander returned to the raft and soon came back with an iron
bar which he made use of to bore a hole for the charge. This was no
easy work. A hole was to be made large enough to hold fifty pounds of
guncotton, whose epansive force is four times that of gunpowder.

helping my uncle to prepare a slow match of wetted powder encased in
linen.

This will do it,  said.

t will, replied my uncle.

y midnight our mining preparations were over the charge was rammed
into the hole, and the slow match uncoiled along the gallery showed
its end outside the opening.

A spark would now develop the whole of our preparations into activity.

TE GEAT ES A TE S W EW


The net day, Thursday, August , is a wellremembered date in our
subterranean ourney. t never returns to my memory without sending
through me a shudder of horror and a palpitation of the heart. From
that hour we had no further occasion for the eercise of reason, or
udgment, or skill, or contrivance. We were henceforth to be hurled
along, the playthings of the fierce elements of the deep.

At si we were afoot. The moment drew near to clear a way by blasting
through the opposing mass of granite.

 begged for the honour of lighting the fuse. This duty done,  was
to oin my companions on the raft, which had not yet been unloaded
we should then push off as far as we could and avoid the dangers
arising from the eplosion, the effects of which were not likely to
be confined to the rock itself.

The fuse was calculated to burn ten minutes before setting fire to
the mine.  therefore had sufficient time to get away to the raft.

 prepared to fulfil my task with some aniety.

After a hasty meal, my uncle and the hunter embarked whilst 
remained on shore.  was supplied with a lighted lantern to set fire
to the fuse. ow go, said my uncle, and return immediately to us.
on't be uneasy,  replied.  will not play by the way. 
immediately proceeded to the mouth of the tunnel.  opened my
lantern.  laid hold of the end of the match. The rofessor stood,
chronometer in hand. eady? he cried.

Ay.

Fire

 instantly plunged the end of the fuse into the lantern. t
spluttered and flamed, and  ran at the top of my speed to the raft.

Come on board uickly, and let us push off.

ans, with a vigorous thrust, sent us from the shore. The raft shot
twenty fathoms out to sea.

t was a moment of intense ecitement. The rofessor was watching the
hand of the chronometer.

Five minutes more he said. Four Three

My pulse beat halfseconds.

Two ne own, granite rocks down with you.

What took place at that moment?  believe  did not hear the dull
roar of the eplosion. ut the rocks suddenly assumed a new
arrangement: they rent asunder like a curtain.  saw a bottomless pit
open on the shore. The sea, lashed into sudden fury, rose up in an
enormous billow, on the ridge of which the unhappy raft was uplifted
bodily in the air with all its crew and cargo.

We all three fell down flat. n less than a second we were in deep,
unfathomable darkness. Then  felt as if not only myself but the raft
also had no support beneath.  thought it was sinking but it was not
so.  wanted to speak to my uncle, but the roaring of the waves
prevented him from hearing even the sound of my voice.

n spite of darkness, noise, astonishment, and terror,  then
understood what had taken place.

n the other side of the blownup rock was an abyss. The eplosion
had caused a kind of earthuake in this fissured and abysmal region
a great gulf had opened and the sea, now changed into a torrent, was
hurrying us along into it.

 gave myself up for lost.

An hour passed awaytwo hours, perhaps cannot tell. We clutched
each other fast, to save ourselves from being thrown off the raft. We
felt violent shocks whenever we were borne heavily against the craggy
proections. et these shocks were not very freuent, from which 
concluded that the gully was widening. t was no doubt the same road
that Saknussemm had taken but instead of walking peaceably down it,
as he had done, we were carrying a whole sea along with us.

These ideas, it will be understood, presented themselves to my mind
in a vague and undetermined form.  had difficulty in associating any
ideas together during this headlong race, which seemed like a
vertical descent. To udge by the air which was whistling past me and
made a whiing in my ears, we were moving faster than the fastest
epress trains. To light a torch under these' conditions would have
been impossible and our last electric apparatus had been shattered
by the force of the eplosion.

 was therefore much surprised to see a clear light shining near me.
t lighted up the calm and unmoved countenance of ans. The skilful
huntsman had succeeded in lighting the lantern and although it
flickered so much as to threaten to go out, it threw a fitful light
across the awful darkness.

 was right in my supposition. t was a wide gallery. The dim light
could not show us both its walls at once. The fall of the waters
which were carrying us away eceeded that of the swiftest rapids in
American rivers. ts surface seemed composed of a sheaf of arrows
hurled with inconceivable force  cannot convey my impressions by a
better comparison. The raft, occasionally seied by an eddy, spun
round as it still flew along. When it approached the walls of the
gallery  threw on them the light of the lantern, and  could udge
somewhat of the velocity of our speed by noticing how the agged
proections of the rocks spun into endless ribbons and bands, so that
we seemed confined within a network of shifting lines.  supposed we
were running at the rate of thirty leagues an hour.

My uncle and  gaed on each other with haggard eyes, clinging to the
stump of the mast, which had snapped asunder at the first shock of
our great catastrophe. We kept our backs to the wind, not to be
stifled by the rapidity of a movement which no human power could
check.

ours passed away. o change in our situation but a discovery came
to complicate matters and make them worse.

n seeking to put our cargo into somewhat better order,  found that
the greater part of the articles embarked had disappeared at the
moment of the eplosion, when the sea broke in upon us with such
violence.  wanted to know eactly what we had saved, and with the
lantern in my hand  began my eamination. f our instruments none
were saved but the compass and the chronometer our stock of ropes
and ladders was reduced to the bit of cord rolled round the stump of
the mast ot a spade, not a pickae, not a hammer was left us and,
irreparable disaster we had only one day's provisions left.

 searched every nook and corner, every crack and cranny in the raft.
There was nothing. ur provisions were reduced to one bit of salt
meat and a few biscuits.

 stared at our failing supplies stupidly.  refused to take in the
gravity of our loss. And yet what was the use of troubling myself. f
we had had provisions enough for months, how could we get out of the
abyss into which we were being hurled by an irresistible torrent? Why
should we fear the horrors of famine, when death was swooping down
upon us in a multitude of other forms? Would there be time left to
die of starvation?

et by an ineplicable play of the imagination  forgot my present
dangers, to contemplate the threatening future. Was there any chance
of escaping from the fury of this impetuous torrent, and of returning
to the surface of the globe?  could not form the slightest
conecture how or when. ut one chance in a thousand, or ten
thousand, is still a chance whilst death from starvation would leave
us not the smallest hope in the world.

The thought came into my mind to declare the whole truth to my uncle,
to show him the dreadful straits to which we were reduced, and to
calculate how long we might yet epect to live. ut  had the courage
to preserve silence.  wished to leave him cool and selfpossessed.

At that moment the light from our lantern began to sink by little and
little, and then went out entirely. The wick had burnt itself out.
lack night reigned again and there was no hope left of being able
to dissipate the palpable darkness. We had yet a torch left, but we
could not have kept it alight. Then, like a child,  closed my eyes
firmly, not to see the darkness.

After a considerable lapse of time our speed redoubled.  could
perceive it by the sharpness of the currents that blew past my face.
The descent became steeper.  believe we were no longer sliding, but
falling down.  had an impression that we were dropping vertically.
My uncle's hand, and the vigorous arm of ans, held me fast.

Suddenly, after a space of time that  could not measure,  felt a
shock. The raft had not struck against any hard resistance, but had
suddenly been checked in its fall. A waterspout, an immense liuid
column, was beating upon the surface of the waters.  was
suffocating  was drowning

ut this sudden flood was not of long duration. n a few seconds 
found myself in the air again, which  inhaled with all the force of
my lungs. My uncle and ans were still holding me fast by the arms
and the raft was still carrying us.

EAG SEE WA TG TE S F AESS


t might have been, as  guessed, about ten at night. The first of my
senses which came into play after this last bout was that of hearing.
All at once  could hear and it was a real eercise of the sense of
hearing.  could hear the silence in the gallery after the din which
for hours had stunned me. At last these words of my uncle's came to
me like a vague murmuring:

We are going up.

What do you mean?  cried.

es, we are going upup

 stretched out my arm.  touched the wall, and drew back my hand
bleeding. We were ascending with etreme rapidity.

The torch The torch cried the rofessor.

ot without difficulty ans succeeded in lighting the torch and the
flame, preserving its upward tendency, threw enough light to show us
what kind of a place we were in.

ust as  thought, said the rofessor We are in a tunnel not
fourandtwenty feet in diameter. The water had reached the bottom of
the gulf. t is now rising to its level, and carrying us with it.

Where to?

 cannot tell but we must be ready for anything. We are mounting at
a speed which seems to me of fourteen feet in a second, or ten miles
an hour. At this rate we shall get on.

es, if nothing stops us if this well has an aperture. ut suppose
it to be stopped. f the air is condensed by the pressure of this
column of water we shall be crushed.

Ael, replied the rofessor with perfect coolness, our situation
is almost desperate but there are some chances of deliverance, and
it is these that  am considering. f at every instant we may perish,
so at every instant we may be saved. et us then be prepared to seie
upon the smallest advantage.

ut what shall we do now?

ecruit our strength by eating.

At these words  fied a haggard eye upon my uncle. That which  had
been so unwilling to confess at last had to be told.

Eat, did you say?

es, at once.

The rofessor added a few words in anish, but ans shook his head
mournfully.

What cried my uncle. ave we lost our provisions?

es here is all we have left one bit of salt meat for the three.

My uncle stared at me as if he could not understand.

Well, said , do you think we have any chance of being saved?

My uestion was unanswered.

An hour passed away.  began to feel the pangs of a violent hunger.
My companions were suffering too, and not one of us dared touch this
wretched remnant of our goodly store.

ut now we were mounting up with ecessive speed. Sometimes the air
would cut our breath short, as is eperienced by aeronauts ascending
too rapidly. ut whilst they suffer from cold in proportion to their
rise, we were beginning to feel a contrary effect. The heat was
increasing in a manner to cause us the most fearful aniety, and
certainly the temperature was at this moment at the height of 
Fahr.

What could be the meaning of such a change? p to this time facts had
supported the theories of avy and of iedenbrock until now
particular conditions of nonconducting rocks, electricity and
magnetism, had tempered the laws of nature, giving us only a
moderately warm climate, for the theory of a central fire remained in
my estimation the only one that was true and eplicable. Were we then
turning back to where the phenomena of central heat ruled in all
their rigour and would reduce the most refractory rocks to the state
of a molten liuid?  feared this, and said to the rofessor:

f we are neither drowned, nor shattered to pieces, nor starved to
death, there is still the chance that we may be burned alive and
reduced to ashes.

At this he shrugged his shoulders and returned to his thoughts.

Another hour passed, and, ecept some slight increase in the
temperature, nothing new had happened.

Come, said he, we must determine upon something.

etermine on what? said .

es, we must recruit our strength by carefully rationing ourselves,
and so prolong our eistence by a few hours. ut we shall be reduced
to very great weakness at last.

And our last hour is not far off.

Well, if there is a chance of safety, if a moment for active
eertion presents itself, where should we find the reuired strength
if we allowed ourselves to be enfeebled by hunger?

Well, uncle, when this bit of meat has been devoured what shall we
have left?

othing, Ael, nothing at all. ut will it do you any more good to
devour it with your eyes than with your teeth? our reasoning has in
it neither sense nor energy.

Then don't you despair?  cried irritably.

o, certainly not, was the rofessor's firm reply.

What do you think there is any chance of safety left?

es,  do as long as the heart beats, as long as body and soul keep
together,  cannot admit that any creature endowed with a will has
need to despair of life.

esolute words these The man who could speak so, under such
circumstances, was of no ordinary type.

Finally, what do you mean to do?  asked.

Eat what is left to the last crumb, and recruit our fading strength.
This meal will be our last, perhaps: so let it be ut at any rate we
shall once more be men, and not ehausted, empty bags.

Well, let us consume it then,  cried.

My uncle took the piece of meat and the few biscuits which had
escaped from the general destruction. e divided them into three
eual portions and gave one to each. This made about a pound of
nourishment for each. The rofessor ate his greedily, with a kind of
feverish rage.  ate without pleasure, almost with disgust ans
uietly, moderately, masticating his small mouthfuls without any
noise, and relishing them with the calmness of a man above all
aniety about the future. y diligent search he had found a flask of
ollands he offered it to us each in turn, and this generous
beverage cheered us up slightly.

Fortrfflig, said ans, drinking in his turn.

Ecellent, replied my uncle.

A glimpse of hope had returned, although without cause. ut our last
meal was over, and it was now five in the morning.

Man is so constituted that health is a purely negative state. unger
once satisfied, it is difficult for a man to imagine the horrors of
starvation they cannot be understood without being felt.

Therefore it was that after our long fast these few mouthfuls of meat
and biscuit made us triumph over our past agonies.

ut as soon as the meal was done, we each of us fell deep into
thought. What was ans thinking ofthat man of the far West, but
who seemed ruled by the fatalist doctrines of the East?

As for me, my thoughts were made up of remembrances, and they carried
me up to the surface of the globe of which  ought never to have
taken leave. The house in the nigstrasse, my poor dear Gruben,
that kind soul Martha, flitted like visions before my eyes, and in
the dismal moanings which from time to time reached my ears  thought
 could distinguish the roar of the traffic of the great cities upon
earth.

My uncle still had his eye upon his work. Torch in hand, he tried to
gather some idea of our situation from the observation of the strata.
This calculation could, at best, be but a vague approimation but a
learned man is always a philosopher when he succeeds in remaining
cool, and assuredly rofessor iedenbrock possessed this uality to a
surprising degree.

 could hear him murmuring geological terms.  could understand them,
and in spite of myself  felt interested in this last geological
study.

Eruptive granite, he was saying. We are still in the primitive
period. ut we are going up, up, higher still. Who can tell?

Ah who can tell? With his hand he was eamining the perpendicular
wall, and in a few more minutes he continued:

This is gneiss here is mica schist Ah presently we shall come to
the transition period, and then

What did the rofessor mean? Could he be trying to measure the
thickness of the crust of the earth that lay between us and the world
above? ad he any means of making this calculation? o, he had not
the aneroid, and no guessing could supply its place.

Still the temperature kept rising, and  felt myself steeped in a
broiling atmosphere.  could only compare it to the heat of a furnace
at the moment when the molten metal is running into the mould.
Gradually we had been obliged to throw aside our coats and
waistcoats, the lightest covering became uncomfortable and even
painful.

Are we rising into a fiery furnace?  cried at one moment when the
heat was redoubling.

o, replied my uncle, that is impossibleuite impossible

et,  answered, feeling the wall, this well is burning hot.

At the same moment, touching the water,  had to withdraw my hand in
haste.

The water is scalding,  cried.

This time the rofessor's only answer was an angry gesture.

Then an unconuerable terror seied upon me, from which  could no
longer get free.  felt that a catastrophe was approaching before
which the boldest spirit must uail. A dim, vague notion laid hold of
my mind, but which was fast hardening into certainty.  tried to
repel it, but it would return.  dared not epress it in plain terms.
et a few involuntary observations confirmed me in my view. y the
flickering light of the torch  could distinguish contortions in the
granite beds a phenomenon was unfolding in which electricity would
play the principal part then this unbearable heat, this boiling
water  consulted the compass.

The compass had lost its properties it had ceased to act properly

pole with a kind of frenied impulse it ran round the dial, and spun
hither and thither as if it were giddy or intoicated.

 knew uite well that according to the best received theories the
mineral covering of the globe is never at absolute rest the changes
brought about by the chemical decomposition of its component parts,
the agitation caused by great liuid torrents, and the magnetic
currents, are continually tending to disturb iteven when living
beings upon its surface may fancy that all is uiet below. A
phenomenon of this kind would not have greatly alarmed me, or at any
rate it would not have given rise to dreadful apprehensions.

ut other facts, other circumstances, of a peculiar nature, came to
reveal to me by degrees the true state of the case. There came
incessant and continuous eplosions.  could only compare them to the
loud rattle of a long train of chariots driven at full speed over the
stones, or a roar of unintermitting thunder.

Then the disordered compass, thrown out of gear by the electric
currents, confirmed me in a growing conviction. The mineral crust of
the globe threatened to burst up, the granite foundations to come
together with a crash, the fissure through which we were helplessly
driven would be filled up, the void would be full of crushed
fragments of rock, and we poor wretched mortals were to be buried and
annihilated in this dreadful consummation.

My uncle,  cried, we are lost now, utterly lost

What are you in a fright about now? was the calm reoinder. What
is the matter with you?

The matter? ook at those uaking walls look at those shivering
rocks. on't you feel the burning heat? on't you see how the water
boils and bubbles? Are you blind to the dense vapours and steam
growing thicker and denser every minute? See this agitated compass
needle. t is an earthuake that is threatening us.

My undaunted uncle calmly shook his head.

o you think, said he, an earthuake is coming?

 do.

Well,  think you are mistaken.

What don't you recognise the symptoms?

f an earthuake? no  am looking out for something better.

What can you mean? Eplain?

t is an eruption, Ael.

An eruption o you mean to affirm that we are running up the shaft
of a volcano?

 believe we are, said the indomitable rofessor with an air of
perfect selfpossession and it is the best thing that could
possibly happen to us under our circumstances.

The best thing Was my uncle stark mad? What did the man mean? and
what was the use of saying facetious things at a time like this?

What  shouted. Are we being taken up in an eruption? ur fate
has flung us here among burning lavas, molten rocks, boiling waters,
and all kinds of volcanic matter we are going to be pitched out,
epelled, tossed up, vomited, spit out high into the air, along with
fragments of rock, showers of ashes and scoria, in the midst of a
towering rush of smoke and flames and it is the best thing that
could happen to us

es, replied the rofessor, eyeing me over his spectacles,  don't
see any other way of reaching the surface of the earth.

 pass rapidly over the thousand ideas which passed through my mind.
My uncle was right, undoubtedly right and never had he seemed to me
more daring and more confirmed in his notions than at this moment
when he was calmly contemplating the chances of being shot out of a
volcano

n the meantime up we went the night passed away in continual
ascent the din and uproar around us became more and more
intensified  was stifled and stunned  thought my last hour was
approaching and yet imagination is such a strong thing that even in
this supreme hour  was occupied with strange and almost childish
speculations. ut  was the victim, not the master, of my own
thoughts.

t was very evident that we were being hurried upward upon the crest
of a wave of eruption beneath our raft were boiling waters, and
under these the more sluggish lava was working its way up in a heated
mass, together with shoals of fragments of rock which, when they
arrived at the crater, would be dispersed in all directions high and
low. We were imprisoned in the shaft or chimney of some volcano.
There was no room to doubt of that.

ut this time, instead of Snfell, an etinct volcano, we were inside
one in full activity.  wondered, therefore, where could this
mountain be, and in what part of the world we were to be shot out.

 made no doubt but that it would be in some northern region. efore
its disorders set in, the needle had never deviated from that
direction. From Cape Saknussemm we had been carried due north for
hundreds of leagues. Were we under celand again? Were we destined to
be thrown up out of ecla, or by which of the seven other fiery
craters in that island? Within a radius of five hundred leagues to
the west  remembered under this parallel of latitude only the
imperfectly known volcanoes of the northeast coast of America. To
the east there was only one in the th degree of north latitude, the
Esk in an Mayen sland, not far from Spitbergen Certainly there
was no lack of craters, and there were some capacious enough to throw
out a whole army ut  wanted to know which of them was to serve us
for an eit from the inner world.

Towards morning the ascending movement became accelerated. f the
heat increased, instead of diminishing, as we approached nearer to
the surface of the globe, this effect was due to local causes alone,
and those volcanic. The manner of our locomotion left no doubt in my
mind. An enormous force, a force of hundreds of atmospheres,
generated by the etreme pressure of confined vapours, was driving us
irresistibly forward. ut to what numberless dangers it eposed us

Soon lurid lights began to penetrate the vertical gallery which
widened as we went up. ight and left  could see deep channels, like
huge tunnels, out of which escaped dense volumes of smoke tongues of
fire lapped the walls, which crackled and sputtered under the intense
heat.

See, see, my uncle  cried.

Well, those are only sulphureous flames and vapours, which one must
epect to see in an eruption. They are uite natural.

ut suppose they should wrap us round.

ut they won't wrap us round.

ut we shall be stifled.

We shall not be stifled at all. The gallery is widening, and if it
becomes necessary, we shall abandon the raft, and creep into a
crevice.

ut the waterthe rising water?

There is no more water, Ael only a lava paste, which is bearing us
up on its surface to the top of the crater.

The liuid column had indeed disappeared, to give place to dense and
still boiling eruptive matter of all kinds. The temperature was
becoming unbearable. A thermometer eposed to this atmosphere would
have marked . The perspiration streamed from my body. ut for the
rapidity of our ascent we should have been suffocated.

ut the rofessor gave up his idea of abandoning the raft, and it was
well he did. owever roughly oined together, those planks afforded
us a firmer support than we could have found anywhere else.

About eight in the morning a new incident occurred. The upward
movement ceased. The raft lay motionless.

What is this?  asked, shaken by this sudden stoppage as if by a
shock.

t is a halt, replied my uncle.

s the eruption checked?  asked.

 hope not.

 rose, and tried to look around me. erhaps the raft itself, stopped
in its course by a proection, was staying the volcanic torrent. f
this were the case we should have to release it as soon as possible.

ut it was not so. The blast of ashes, scori, and rubbish had ceased
to rise.

as the eruption stopped?  cried.

Ah said my uncle between his clenched teeth, you are afraid. ut
don't alarm yourselfthis lull cannot last long. t has lasted now
five minutes, and in a short time we shall resume our ourney to the
mouth of the crater.

As he spoke, the rofessor continued to consult his chronometer, and
he was again right in his prognostications. The raft was soon hurried
and driven forward with a rapid but irregular movement, which lasted
about ten minutes, and then stopped again.

ery good, said my uncle in ten minutes more we shall be off
again, for our present business lies with an intermittent volcano. t
gives us time now and then to take breath.

This was perfectly true. When the ten minutes were over we started
off again with renewed and increased speed. We were obliged to lay
fast hold of the planks of the raft, not to be thrown off. Then again
the paroysm was over.

 have since reflected upon this singular phenomenon without being
able to eplain it. At any rate it was clear that we were not in the
main shaft of the volcano, but in a lateral gallery where there were
felt recurrent tunes of reaction.

ow often this operation was repeated  cannot say. All  know is,
that at each fresh impulse we were hurled forward with a greatly
increased force, and we seemed as if we were mere proectiles. uring
the short halts we were stifled with the heat whilst we were being
proected forward the hot air almost stopped my breath.  thought for
a moment how delightful it would be to find myself carried suddenly
into the arctic regions, with a cold  below the freeing point. My
overheated brain conured up visions of white plains of cool snow,
where  might roll and allay my feverish heat. ittle by little my
brain, weakened by so many constantly repeated shocks, seemed to be
giving way altogether. ut for the strong arm of ans  should more
than once have had my head broken against the granite roof of our
burning dungeon.

 have therefore no eact recollection of what took place during the
following hours.  have a confused impression left of continuous
eplosions, loud detonations, a general shaking of the rocks all
around us, and of a spinning movement with which our raft was once
whirled helplessly round. t rocked upon the lava torrent, amidst a
dense fall of ashes. Snorting flames darted their fiery tongues at
us. There were wild, fierce puffs of stormy wind from below,
resembling the blasts of vast iron furnaces blowing all at one time
and  caught a glimpse of the figure of ans lighted up by the fire
and all the feeling  had left was ust what  imagine must be the
feeling of an unhappy criminal doomed to be blown away alive from the
mouth of a cannon, ust before the trigger is pulled, and the flying
limbs and rags of flesh and skin fill the uivering air and spatter
the bloodstained ground.

S AS  TE E METEAEA


When  opened my eyes again  felt myself grasped by the belt with
the strong hand of our guide. With the other arm he supported my
uncle.  was not seriously hurt, but  was shaken and bruised and
battered all over.  found myself lying on the sloping side of a
mountain only two yards from a gaping gulf, which would have
swallowed me up had  leaned at all that way. ans had saved me from
death whilst  lay rolling on the edge of the crater.

Where are we? asked my uncle irascibly, as if he felt much inured
by being landed upon the earth again.

The hunter shook his head in token of complete ignorance.

s it celand?  asked.

e, replied ans.

What ot celand? cried the rofessor.

ans must be mistaken,  said, raising myself up.

This was our final surprise after all the astonishing events of our
wonderful ourney.  epected to see a white cone covered with the
eternal snow of ages rising from the midst of the barren deserts of
the icy north, faintly lighted with the pale rays of the arctic sun,
far away in the highest latitudes known but contrary to all our
epectations, my uncle, the celander, and myself were sitting
halfway down a mountain baked under the burning rays of a southern
sun, which was blistering us with the heat, and blinding us with the
fierce light of his nearly vertical rays.

 could not believe my own eyes but the heated air and the sensation
of burning left me no room for doubt. We had come out of the crater
half naked, and the radiant orb to which we had been strangers for
two months was lavishing upon us out of his blaing splendours more
of his light and heat than we were able to receive with comfort.

When my eyes had become accustomed to the bright light to which they
had been so long strangers,  began to use them to set my imagination
right. At least  would have it to be Spitbergen, and  was in no
humour to give up this notion.

The rofessor was the first to speak, and said:

Well, this is not much like celand.

ut is it an Mayen?  asked.

or that either, he answered. This is no northern mountain here
are no granite peaks capped with snow. ook, Ael, look

Above our heads, at a height of five hundred feet or more, we saw the
crater of a volcano, through which, at intervals of fifteen minutes
or so, there issued with loud eplosions lofty columns of fire,
mingled with pumice stones, ashes, and flowing lava.  could feel the
heaving of the mountain, which seemed to breathe like a huge whale,
and puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes. eneath, down a
pretty steep declivity, ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred
feet, giving the mountain a height of about , or , feet. ut
the base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich
verdure, amongst which  was able to distinguish the olive, the fig,
and vines, covered with their luscious purple bunches.

 was forced to confess that there was nothing arctic here.

When the eye passed beyond these green surroundings it rested on a
wide, blue epanse of sea or lake, which appeared to enclose this
enchanting island, within a compass of only a few leagues. Eastward
lay a pretty little white seaport town or village, with a few houses
scattered around it, and in the harbour of which a few vessels of
peculiar rig were gently swayed by the softly swelling waves. eyond
it, groups of islets rose from the smooth, blue waters, but in such
numbers that they seemed to dot the sea like a shoal. To the west
distant coasts lined the dim horion, on some rose blue mountains of
smooth, undulating forms on a more distant coast arose a prodigious
cone crowned on its summit with a snowy plume of white cloud. To the
northward lay spread a vast sheet of water, sparkling and dancing
under the hot, bright rays, the uniformity broken here and there by
the topmast of a gallant ship appearing above the horion, or a
swelling sail moving slowly before the wind.

This unforeseen spectacle was most charming to eyes long used to
underground darkness.

Where are we? Where are we?  asked faintly.

ans closed his eyes with lay indifference. What did it matter to
him? My uncle looked round with dumb surprise.

Well, whatever mountain this may be, he said at last, it is very
hot here. The eplosions are going on still, and  don't think it
would look well to have come out by an eruption, and then to get our
heads broken by bits of falling rock. et us get down. Then we shall
know better what we are about. esides,  am starving, and parching
with thirst.

ecidedly the rofessor was not given to contemplation. For my part,
 could for another hour or two have forgotten my hunger and my
fatigue to enoy the lovely scene before me but  had to follow my
companions.

The slope of the volcano was in many places of great steepness. We
slid down screes of ashes, carefully avoiding the lava streams which
glided sluggishly by us like fiery serpents. As we went  chattered
and asked all sorts of uestions as to our whereabouts, for  was too
much ecited not to talk a great deal.

We are in Asia,  cried, on the coasts of ndia, in the Malay
slands, or in ceania. We have passed through half the globe, and
come out nearly at the antipodes.

ut the compass? said my uncle.

Ay, the compass  said, greatly puled. According to the compass
we have gone northward.

as it lied?

Surely not. Could it lie?

nless, indeed, this is the orth ole

h, no, it is not the ole but

Well, here was something that baffled us completely.  could not tell
what to say.

ut now we were coming into that delightful greenery, and  was
suffering greatly from hunger and thirst. appily, after two hours'
walking, a charming country lay open before us, covered with olive
trees, pomegranate trees, and delicious vines, all of which seemed to
belong to anybody who pleased to claim them. esides, in our state of
destitution and famine we were not likely to be particular. h, the
inepressible pleasure of pressing those cool, sweet fruits to our
lips, and eating grapes by mouthfuls off the rich, full bunches ot
far off, in the grass, under the delicious shade of the trees, 
discovered a spring of fresh, cool water, in which we luuriously
bathed our faces, hands, and feet.

Whilst we were thus enoying the sweets of repose a child appeared
out of a grove of olive trees.

Ah  cried, here is an inhabitant of this happy land

t was but a poor boy, miserably illclad, a sufferer from poverty,
and our aspect seemed to alarm him a great deal in fact, only half
clothed, with ragged hair and beards, we were a suspiciouslooking
party and if the people of the country knew anything about thieves,
we were very likely to frighten them.

ust as the poor little wretch was going to take to his heels, ans
caught hold of him, and brought him to us, kicking and struggling.

My uncle began to encourage him as well as he could, and said to him
in good German:

Was heist diesen erg, mein nablein? Sage mir geschwind

What is this mountain called, my little friend?

The child made no answer.

ery well, said my uncle.  infer that we are not in Germany.

e put the same uestion in English.

We got no forwarder.  was a good deal puled.

s the child dumb? cried the rofessor, who, proud of his knowledge
of many languages, now tried French: Comment appelleton cette
montagne, mon enfant?

Silence still.

ow let us try talian, said my uncle and he said:

ove noi siamo?

es, where are we?  impatiently repeated.

ut there was no answer still.

Will you speak when you are told? eclaimed my uncle, shaking the
urchin by the ears. Come si noma uesta isola?

STM, replied the little herdboy, slipping out of ans' hands,
and scudding into the plain across the olive trees.

We were hardly thinking of that. Stromboli What an effect this
unepected name produced upon my mind We were in the midst of the
Mediterranean Sea, on an island of the olian archipelago, in the
ancient Strongyle, where olus kept the winds and the storms chained
up, to be let loose at his will. And those distant blue mountains in
the east were the mountains of Calabria. And that threatening volcano
far away in the south was the fierce Etna.

Stromboli, Stromboli  repeated.

My uncle kept time to my eclamations with hands and feet, as well as
with words. We seemed to be chanting in chorus

What a ourney we had accomplished ow marvellous aving entered by
one volcano, we had issued out of another more than two thousand
miles from Snfell and from that barren, faraway celand The
strange chances of our epedition had carried us into the heart of
the fairest region in the world. We had echanged the bleak regions
of perpetual snow and of impenetrable barriers of ice for those of
brightness and 'the rich hues of all glorious things.' We had left
over our heads the murky sky and cold fogs of the frigid one to
revel under the aure sky of taly

After our delicious repast of fruits and cold, clear water we set off
again to reach the port of Stromboli. t would not have been wise to
tell how we came there. The superstitious talians would have set us
down for firedevils vomited out of hell so we presented ourselves
in the humble guise of shipwrecked mariners. t was not so glorious,
but it was safer.

n my way  could hear my uncle murmuring: ut the compass that
compass t pointed due north. ow are we to eplain that fact?

My opinion is,  replied disdainfully, that it is best not to
eplain it. That is the easiest way to shelve the difficulty.

ndeed, sir The occupant of a professorial chair at the ohannum
unable to eplain the reason of a cosmical phenomenon Why, it would
be simply disgraceful

And as he spoke, my uncle, half undressed, in rags, a perfect
scarecrow, with his leathern belt around him, settling his spectacles
upon his nose and looking learned and imposing, was himself again,
the terrible German professor of mineralogy.

ne hour after we had left the grove of olives, we arrived at the
little port of San iceno, where ans claimed his thirteen week's
wages, which was counted out to him with a hearty shaking of hands
all round.

At that moment, if he did not share our natural emotion, at least his
countenance epanded in a manner very unusual with him, and while
with the ends of his fingers he lightly pressed our hands,  believe
he smiled.

A'S WE TAT ES WE


Such is the conclusion of a history which  cannot epect everybody
to believe, for some people will believe nothing against the
testimony of their own eperience. owever,  am indifferent to their
incredulity, and they may believe as much or as little as they please.

The Stromboliotes received us kindly as shipwrecked mariners. They
gave us food and clothing. After waiting fortyeight hours, on the 
st of August, a small craft took us to Messina, where a few days'
rest completely removed the effect of our fatigues.

n Friday, September the th, we embarked on the steamer olturno,
employed by the French Messageries mperiales, and in three days more
we were at Marseilles, having no care on our minds ecept that
abominable deceitful compass, which we had mislaid somewhere and
could not now eamine but its ineplicable behaviour eercised my
mind fearfully. n the th of September, in the evening, we arrived
at amburg.

 cannot describe to you the astonishment of Martha or the oy of
Gruben.

ow you are a hero, Ael, said to me my blushing fiance, my
betrothed, you will not leave me again

 looked tenderly upon her, and she smiled through her tears.

ow can  describe the etraordinary sensation produced by the return
of rofessor iedenbrock? Thanks to Martha's ineradicable tattling,
the news that the rofessor had gone to discover a way to the centre
of the earth had spread over the whole civilised world. eople
refused to believe it, and when they saw him they would not believe
him any the more. Still, the appearance of ans, and sundry pieces of
intelligence derived from celand, tended to shake the confidence of
the unbelievers.

Then my uncle became a great man, and  was now the nephew of a great
manwhich is not a privilege to be despised.

amburg gave a grand fete in our honour. A public audience was given
to the rofessor at the ohannum, at which he told all about our
epedition, with only one omission, the uneplained and ineplicable
behaviour of our compass. n the same day, with much state, he
deposited in the archives of the city the now famous document of
Saknussemm, and epressed his regret that circumstances over which he
had no control had prevented him from following to the very centre of
the earth the track of the learned celander. e was modest
notwithstanding his glory, and he was all the more famous for his
humility.

So much honour could not but ecite envy. There were those who envied
him his fame and as his theories, resting upon known facts, were in
opposition to the systems of science upon the uestion of the central
fire, he sustained with his pen and by his voice remarkable
discussions with the learned of every country.

For my part  cannot agree with his theory of gradual cooling: in
spite of what  have seen and felt,  believe, and always shall
believe, in the central heat. ut  admit that certain circumstances
not yet sufficiently understood may tend to modify in places the
action of natural phenomena.

While these uestions were being debated with great animation, my
uncle met with a real sorrow. ur faithful ans, in spite of our
entreaties, had left amburg the man to whom we owed all our success
and our lives too would not suffer us to reward him as we could have
wished. e was seied with the mal de pays, a complaint for which we
have not even a name in English.

Farval, said he one day and with that simple word he left us and
sailed for ekiavik, which he reached in safety.

We were strongly attached to our brave eiderdown hunter though far
away in the remotest north, he will never be forgotten by those whose
lives he protected, and certainly  shall not fail to endeavour to
see him once more before  die.

To conclude,  have to add that this 'ourney into the nterior of
the Earth' created a wonderful sensation in the world. t was
translated into all civilised languages. The leading newspapers
etracted the most interesting passages, which were commented upon,
picked to pieces, discussed, attacked, and defended with eual
enthusiasm and determination, both by believers and sceptics. are
privilege my uncle enoyed during his lifetime the glory he had
deservedly won and he may even boast the distinguished honour of an
offer from Mr. arnum, to ehibit him on most advantageous terms in
all the principal cities in the nited States

ut there was one 'dead fly' amidst all this glory and honour one
fact, one incident, of the ourney remained a mystery. ow to a man
eminent for his learning, an uneplained phenomenon is an unbearable
hardship. Well it was yet reserved for my uncle to be completely
happy.

ne day, while arranging a collection of minerals in his cabinet, 
noticed in a corner this unhappy compass, which we had long lost
sight of  opened it, and began to watch it.

t had been in that corner for si months, little mindful of the
trouble it was giving.

Suddenly, to my intense astonishment,  noticed a strange fact, and 
uttered a cry of surprise.

What is the matter? my uncle asked.

That compass

Well?

See, its poles are reversed

eversed?

es, they point the wrong way.

My uncle looked, he compared, and the house shook with his triumphant
leap of eultation.

A light broke in upon his spirit and mine.

See there, he cried, as soon as he was able to speak. After our
arrival at Cape Saknussemm the north pole of the needle of this
confounded compass began to point south instead of north.

Evidently

ere, then, is the eplanation of our mistake. ut what phenomenon
could have caused this reversal of the poles?

The reason is evident, uncle.

Tell me, then, Ael.

uring the electric storm on the iedenbrock sea, that ball of fire,
which magnetised all the iron on board, reversed the poles of our
magnet

Aha aha shouted the rofessor with a loud laugh. So it was ust
an electric oke

From that day forth the rofessor was the most glorious of savants,
and  was the happiest of men for my pretty irlandaise, resigning
her place as ward, took her position in the old house on the
nigstrasse in the double capacity of niece to my uncle and wife to
a certain happy youth. What is the need of adding that the
illustrious tto iedenbrock, corresponding member of all the
scientific, geographical, and mineralogical societies of all the
civilised world, was now her uncle and mine?

Section .  General nformation About roect Gutenbergtm electronic
works.

rofessor Michael S. art is the originator of the roect Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed roect
Gutenbergtm eooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


roect Gutenbergtm eooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as ublic omain in the .S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main G search facility:

This Web site includes information about roect Gutenbergtm,
including how to make donations to the roect Gutenberg iterary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eooks.
