Spencer Chambers frowned at the spacegram on the desk before him. ohn
Moore Mallory. That was the man who had caused so much trouble in the
ovian elections. The troublemaker who had shouted for an investigation
of nterplanetary ower. The man who had said that Spencer Chambers and
nterplanetary ower were waging economic war against the people of the
Solar System.

Chambers smiled. With long, wellkept fingers, he rubbed his irongray
mustache.

ohn Moore Mallory was right for that reason, he was a dangerous man.
rison was the place for him, but probably a prison outside the ovian
confederacy. erhaps one of the prison ships that plied to the edge of
the System, clear to the orbit of luto. r would the prison on Mercury
be better?

Spencer Chambers leaned back in his chair and matched his fingertips,
staring at them, frowning again.

Mercury was a hard place. A man's life wasn't worth much there. Working
in the power plants, where the Sun poured out its flaming blast of heat,
and radiations sucked the energy from one's body, in si months, a year
at most, any man was finished.

Chambers shook his head. ot Mercury. e had nothing against Mallory. e
had never met the man but he rather liked him. Mallory was ust a man
fighting for a principle, the same as Chambers was doing.

e was sorry that it had been necessary to put Mallory in prison. f the
man only had listened to reason, had accepted the proposals that had
been made, or ust had dropped out of sight until the ovian elections
were over ... or at least had moderated his charges. ut when he had
attempted to reveal the offers, which he termed bribery, something had
to be done.

udwig Stutsman had handled that part of it. rilliant fellow, this
Stutsman, but as mean a human as ever walked on two legs. A man utterly
without mercy, entirely without principle. A man who would stoop to any
depth. ut a useful man, a good one to have around to do the dirty work.
And dirty work sometimes was necessary.

Chambers picked up the spacegram again and studied it. Stutsman, out on
Callisto now, had sent it. e was doing a good ob out there. The ovian
confederacy, less than one Earth year under nterplanetary domination,
was still half rebellious, still angry at being forced to turn over its
government to the handpicked officials of Chambers' company. An iron
heel was needed and Stutsman was that iron heel.

                                   

So the people on the ovian satellites wanted the release of ohn Moore
Mallory. They're getting ugly, the spacegram said. t had been a
mistake to confine Mallory to Callisto. Stutsman should have thought of
that.

Chambers would instruct Stutsman to remove Mallory from the Callisto
prison, place him on one of the prison ships. Give instructions to the
captain to make things comfortable for him. When this furor had blown
over, after things had uieted down in the ovian confederacy, it might
be possible to release Mallory. After all, the man wasn't really guilty
of any crime. t was a shame that he should be imprisoned when
racketeering rats like Scorio went scotfree right here in ew ork.

A buer purred softly and Chambers reached out to press a stud.

r. Craven to see you, his secretary said. ou asked to see him, Mr.
Chambers.

All right, said Chambers. Send him right in.

e clicked the stud again, picked up his pen, wrote out a spacegram to
Stutsman, and signed it.

r. erbert Craven stood ust inside the door, his black suit wrinkled
and untidy, his sparse sandy hair standing on end.

ou sent for me, he said sourly.

Sit down, octor, invited Chambers.

                                   

Craven sat down. e peered at Chambers through thicklensed glasses.

 haven't much time, he declared acidly.

Cigar? Chambers offered.

ever smoke.

A drink, then?

ou know  don't drink, snapped Craven.

octor, said Chambers, you're the least sociable man 've ever known.
What do you do to enoy yourself?

 work, said Craven.  find it interesting.

ou must. ou even begrudge the time it takes to talk with me.

 won't deny it. What do you want this time?

Chambers swung about to face him suarely across the desk. There was a
cold look in the financier's gray eyes and his lips were grim.

Craven, he said,  don't trust you. 've never trusted you. robably
that's no news to you.

ou don't trust anyone, countered Craven. ou're watching everybody
all the time.

ou sold me a gadget  didn't need five years ago, said Chambers. ou
outfoed me and  don't hold it against you. n fact, it almost made me
admire you. ecause of that  put you under a contract, one that you and
all the lawyers in hell can't break, because someday you'll find
something valuable, and when you do,  want it. A million a year is a
high price to pay to protect myself against you, but  think it's worth
it. f  didn't think so, 'd have turned you over to Stutsman long ago.
Stutsman knows how to handle men like you.

ou mean, said Craven, that you've found 'm working on something 
haven't reported to you.

That's eactly it.

ou'll get a report when  have something to report. ot before.

That's all right, said Chambers.  ust wanted you to know.

Craven got to his feet slowly. These talks with you are so refreshing,
he remarked.

We'll have to have them oftener, said Chambers.

Craven banged the door as he went out.

Chambers stared after him. A ueer man, the most astute scientific mind
anywhere, but not a man to be trusted.

                                   

The president of nterplanetary ower rose from his chair and walked to
the window. elow spread the roaring inferno of ew ork, greatest city
in the Solar System, a strange place of ueer beauty and weighty
materialism, dreamlike in its superskyscraper construction, but
utilitarian in its purpose, for it was a port of many planets.

The afternoon sunlight slanted through the window, softening the
irongray hair of the man who stood there. is shoulders almost blocked
the window, for he had the body of a fighting man, one, moreover, in
good condition. is shortclipped mustache rode with an air of dignity
above his thin, rugged mouth.

is eyes looked out on the city, but did not see it. Through his brain
went the vision of a dream that was coming true. is dream spun its
fragile net about the planets of the Solar System, about their moons,
about every single foot of planetary ground where men had gone to build
and create a second homelandthe mines of Mercury and the farms of
enus, the pleasurelands of Mars and the mighty domed cities on the
moons of upiter, the moons of Saturn and the great, cold laboratories
of luto.

ower was the key, supplied by the accumulators owned and rented by
nterplanetary ower. A monopoly of power. ower that enus and Mercury
had too much of, must sell on the market, and that the other planets and
satellites needed. ower to drive huge spaceships across the void, to
turn the wheels of industry, to heat the domes on colder worlds. ower
to make possible the life and functioning of mankind on hostile worlds.

n the great power plants of Mercury and enus, the accumulators were
charged and then shipped out to those other worlds where power was
needed. Accumulators were rented, never sold. ecause they belonged at
all times to nterplanetary ower, they literally held the fate of all
the planets in their cells.

A few accumulators were manufactured and sold by other smaller
companies, but they were few and the price was high. nterplanetary saw
to that. When the cry of monopoly was raised, nterplanetary could point
to these other manufacturers as proof that there was no restraint of
trade. nder the statute no monopoly could be charged, but the cost of
manufacturing accumulators alone was protection against serious
competition from anyone.

pon a satisfactory, efficient powerstorage device rested the success
or failure of space travel itself. That device and the power it stored
were for sale by nterplanetary ... and, to all practical purposes, by
nterplanetary only.

Accordingly, year after year, nterplanetary had tightened its grip upon
the Solar System. Mercury was virtually owned by the company. Mars and
enus were little more than puppet states. And now the government of the
ovian confederacy was in the hands of men who acknowledged Spencer
Chambers as their master. n Earth the agents and the lobbyists
representing nterplanetary swarmed in every capital, even in the
capital of the Central European Federation, whose people were dominated
by an absolute dictatorship. For even Central Europe needed
accumulators.

Economic dictatorship, said Spencer Chambers to himself. That's what
ohn Moore Mallory called it. Well, why not? Such a dictatorship would
insure the best business brains at the heads of the governments, would
give the Solar System a business administration, would guard against the
mistakes of popular government.

emocracies were based on a false presumptionthe theory that all
people were fit to rule. t granted intelligence where there was no
intelligence. t presumed ability where there was not the slightest
trace of any. t gave the idiot the same political standing as the wise
man, the crackpot the same political opportunity as the man of
wellgrounded common sense, the weakling the same voice as the strong
man. t was government by emotion rather than by udgment.

                                   

Spencer Chambers' face took on stern lines. There was no softness left
now. The late afternoon sunlight painted angles and threw shadows and
created highlights that made him look almost like a granite mask on a
solid granite body.

There was no room for Mallory's nonsense in a dynamic, epanding
civiliation. o reason to kill himeven he might have value under
certain circumstances, and no really efficient eecutive destroys
valuebut he had to be out of the way where his mobrousing tongue
could do no damage. The damned fool What good would his idiotic
idealism do him on a prison spaceship?




CATE TW


ussell age suinted thoughtful eyes at the thing he had createda
transparent cloud, a visible, sharply outlined cloud of something. t
was visible as a piece of glass is visible, as a globe of water is
visible. There it lay, within his apparatus, a thing that shouldn't be.

 believe we have something there, arry, he said slowly.

arry Wilson sucked at the cigarette that drooped from the corner of his
mouth, blew twin streams of smoke from his nostrils. is eyes twitched
nervously.

eah, he said. Antientropy.

All of that, said ussell age. erhaps a whole lot more.

t stops all energy change, said Wilson, as if time stood still and
things remained eactly as they were when time had stopped.

t's more than that, age declared. t conserves not only energy in
toto, not only the energy of the whole, but the energy of the part. t
is perfectly transparent, yet it has refractive ualities. t won't
absorb light because to do so would change its energy content. n that
field, whatever is hot stays hot, whatever is cold can't gain heat.

e scraped his hand over a week's growth of beard, considering. From his
pocket he took a pipe and a leather pouch. Thoughtfully he filled the
pipe and lit it.

t had started with his eperiments in Force Field , an eperiment to
observe the effects of heating a conductor in that field. t had been
impossible to heat the conductor electrically, for that would have upset
the field, changed it, twisted it into something else. So he had used a
unsen burner.

Through halfclosed eyes, he still could see that slender strand of
imperm wire, how its silvery length had turned to red under the blue
flame. eep red at first and then brighter until it flamed in almost
whitehot incandescence. And all the while the humming of the
transformer as the force field built up. The humming of the transformer
and the muted roaring of the burner and the glowing heat in the length
of wire.

Something had happened then ... an awesome something. A weird wrench as
if some greater power, some greater law had taken hold. A glove of
force, invisible, but somehow sensed, had closed about the wire and
flame. nstantly the roaring of the burner changed in tone an odor of
gas spewed out of the vents at its base. Something had cut off the flow
of flame in the brass tube. Some force, something ...

The flame was a transparent cloud. The blue and red of flame and hot
wire had changed, in the whiplash of a second, to a refractive but
transparent cloud that hung there within the apparatus.

                                   

The red color had vanished from the wire as the blue had vanished from
the flame. The wire was shining. t wasn't silvery it wasn't white.
There was no hint of color, ust a refractive blur that told him the
wire was there. Colorless reflection. And that meant perfect
reflection The most perfect reflectors reflect little more than  per
cent of the light incident and the absorption of the two per cent colors
those reflectors as copper or gold or chromium. ut the imperm wire
within that force field that had been flame a moment before, was
reflecting all light.

e had cut the wire with a pair of shears and it had still hung,
unsupported, in the air, unchanging within the shimmer that constituted
something no man had ever seen before.

ou can't put energy in, said age, talking to himself, chewing the
bit of his pipe. ou can't take energy out. t's still as hot as it
was at the moment the change came. ut it can't radiate any of that
heat. t can't radiate any kind of energy.

Why, even the wire was reflective, so that it couldn't absorb energy and
thus disturb the balance that eisted within that bit of space. ot only
energy itself was preserved, but the very form of energy.

ut why? That was the uestion that hammered at him. Why? efore he
could go ahead, he had to know why.

erhaps the verging of the field toward Field ? Somewhere in between
those two fields of force, somewhere within that almost noneistent
borderline which separated them, he might find the secret.

ising to his feet, he knocked out his pipe.

arry, he announced, we have work to do.

Smoke drooled from Wilson's nostrils.

eah, he said.

age had a sudden urge to lash out and hit the man. That eternal
drooling of smoke out of his nostrils, that everlasting cigarette
dangling limply from one corner of his mouth, the shifty eyes, the dirty
fingernails, got on his nerves.

ut Wilson was a mechanical genius. is hands were clever despite the
dirty nails. They could fashion pinhead cameras and threegram
electroscopes or balances capable of measuring the pressure of
electronic impacts. As a laboratory assistant he was unbeatable. f only
he wouldn't answer every statement or uestion with that nerveracking
'yeah'

age stopped in front of a smaller room, enclosed by heavy uart.
nside that room was the great bank of mercuryvapor rectifiers. From
them lashed a bluegreen glare that splashed against his face and
shoulders, painting him in angry, garish color. The glass guarded him
from the terrific blast of ultraviolet light that flared from the pool
of shimmering molten metal, a terrible emanation that would have flayed
a man's skin from his body within the space of seconds.

                                   

The scientist suinted his eyes against the glare. There was something
in it that caught him with a deadly fascination. The personification of
powerthe incredibly intense spot of incandescent vapor, the tiny
sphere of bluegreen fire, the spinning surge of that shining pool, the
intense glare of ioniation.

ower ... the breath of modern mankind, the pulse of progress.

n an adacent room were the accumulators. ot nterplanetary
accumulators, which he would have had to rent, but ones he had bought
from a small manufacturer who turned out only ten or fifteen thousand a
year ... not enough to bother nterplanetary.

Gregory Manning had made it possible for him to buy those accumulators.
Manning had made many things possible in this little laboratory hidden
deep within the heart of the Sierras, many miles from any other
habitation.

Manning's grandfather, ackson Manning, had first generated the
curvature field and overcome gravity, had left his grandson a fortune
that approached the fivebillion mark. ut that had not been all. From
his famous ancestor, Manning had inherited a keen, sharp, scientific
mind. From his mother's father, Anthony arret, he had gained an astute
business sense. ut unlike his maternal grandfather, he had not turned
his attention entirely to business. ld Man arret had virtually ruled
Wall Street for almost a generation, had become a financial myth linked
with keen business sense, with an uncanny ability to handle men and
money. ut his grandson, Gregory Manning, had become known to the world
in a different way. For while he had inherited scientific ability from
one side of the family, financial sense from the other, he likewise had
inherited from some other ancestorperhaps remote and unknowna
wanderlust that had taken him to the farthest outposts of the Solar
System.

                                   

t was Gregory Manning who had financed and headed the rescue epedition
which took the first luto flight off that dark icebo of a world when
the eploration ship had crashed. t was he who had piloted home the
winning ship in the upiter derby, sending his bulleting craft screaming
around the mighty planet in a time which set a Solar record. t was
Gregory Manning who had entered the enusian swamps and brought back,
alive, the mystery liard that had been reported there. And he was the
one who had flown the serum to Mercury when the lives of ten thousand
men depended upon the thrumming engines that drove the shining ship
inward toward the Sun.

ussell age had known him since college days. They had worked out their
eperiments together in the school laboratories, had spent long hours
arguing and wondering ... debating scientific theories. oth had loved
the same girl, both had lost her, and together they had been bitter over
it ... drowning their bitterness in a threeday drunk that made campus
history.

After graduation Gregory Manning had gone on to world fame, had roamed
over the face of every planet ecept upiter and Saturn, had visited
every inhabited moon, had climbed unar mountains, penetrated enusian
swamps, crossed Martian deserts, driven by a need to see and eperience
that would not let him rest. ussell age had sunk into obscurity, had
buried himself in scientific research, coming more and more to aim his
effort at the discovery of a new source of power ... power that would be
cheap, that would destroy the threat of nterplanetary dictatorship.

age turned away from the rectifier room.

Maybe 'll have something to show Greg soon, he told himself. Maybe,
after all these years....

                                   

Forty minutes after age put through the call to Chicago, Gregory
Manning arrived. The scientist, watching for him from the tiny lawn that
surrounded the combined home and laboratory, saw his plane bullet into
sight, scream down toward the little field and make a perfect landing.

urrying toward the plane as Gregory stepped out of it, ussell noted
that his friend looked the same as ever, though it had been a year or
more since he had seen him. The thing that was discomfiting about Greg
was his apparently enduring youthfulness.

e was clad in odhpurs and boots and an old tweed coat, with a
brilliant blue stock at his throat. e waved a hand in greeting and
hurried forward. uss heard the grating of his boots across the gravel
of the walk.

Greg's face was bleak it always was. A clean, smooth face, hard, with
something stern about the eyes.

is grip almost crushed uss's hand, but his tone was crisp. ou
sounded ecited, uss.

 have a right to be, said the scientist.  think  have found
something at last.

Atomic power? asked Manning. There was no flutter of ecitement in his
voice, ust a little hardening of the lines about his eyes, a little
tensing of the muscles in his cheeks.

uss shook his head. ot atomic energy. f it's anything, it's material
energy, the secret of the energy of matter.

They halted before two lawn chairs.

et's sit down here, invited uss.  can tell it to you out here,
show it to you afterward. t isn't often  can be outdoors.

t is a fine place, said Greg.  can smell the pines.

The laboratory perched on a ledge of rugged rock, nearly , feet
above sea level. efore them the land swept down in agged ruggedness
to a valley far below, where a stream flashed in the noonday sun. eyond
climbed pineclad slopes and far in the distance gleamed shimmering
spires of snowcapped peaks.

From his leather acket uss hauled forth his pipe and tobacco, lighted
up.

t was this way, he said. eaning back comfortably he outlined the
first eperiment. Manning listened intently.

ow comes the funny part, uss added.  had hopes before, but 
believe this is what put me on the right track.  took a metal rod, a
welding rod, you know.  pushed it into that solidified force field, if
that is what you'd call it ... although that doesn't describe it. The
rod went in. Took a lot of pushing, but it went in. And though the field
seemed entirely transparent, you couldn't see the rod, even after  had
pushed enough of it in so it should have come out the other side. t was
as if it hadn't entered the sphere of force at all. As if  were ust
telescoping the rod and its density were increasing as  pushed, like
pushing it back into itself, but that, of course, wouldn't have been
possible.

e paused and puffed at his pipe, his eyes fied on the snowy peaks far
in the purple distance. Manning waited.

Finally the rod came out, uss went on. Mind you, it came out, even
after  would have sworn, if  had relied alone upon my eyes, that it
hadn't entered the sphere at all. ut it came out ninety degrees
removed from its point of entry

Wait a second, said Manning. This doesn't check. id you do it more
than once?

 did it a doen times and the results were the same each time. ut you
haven't heard the half of it. When  pulled that rod outyes,  could
pull it outit was a good two inches shorter than when  had pushed it
in.  couldn't believe that part of it. t was even harder to believe
than that the rod should come out ninety degrees from its point of
entry.  measured the rods after that and made sure. ept an accurate
record. Every single one of them lost approimately two inches by being
shoved into the sphere. Every single one of them repeated the phenomenon
of curving within the sphere to come out somewhere else than where  had
inserted them.

                                   

Any eplanation of it? asked Manning, and now there was a cold chill
of ecitement in his voice.

Theories, no real eplanations. emember that you can't see the rod
after you push it into the sphere. t's ust as if it isn't there.
Well, maybe it isn't. ou can't disturb anything within that sphere or
you'd change the sum of potentialkineticpressure energies within it.
The sphere seems dedicated to that one thing ... it cannot change. f
the rod struck the imperm wire within the field, it would press the wire
down, would use up energy, decrease the potential energy. So the rod
simply had to miss it somehow.  believe it moved into some higher
plane of eistence and went around. And in doing that it had to turn so
many corners, so many fourthdimensional corners, that the length was
used up. r maybe it was increased in density. 'm not sure. erhaps no
one will ever know.

Why didn't you tell me about this sooner? demanded Manning.  should
have been out here helping you. Maybe  wouldn't be much good, but 
might have helped.

ou'll have your chance, uss told him. We're ust starting.  wanted
to be sure  had something before  troubled you.  tried other things
with that first sphere.  found that metal pushed through the sphere
will conduct an electrical current, which is pretty definite proof that
the metal isn't within the sphere at all. Glass can be forced through it
without breaking. ot fleible glass, but rods of plain old brittle
glass. t turns without breaking, and it also loses some of its length.
Water can be forced through a tube inserted in the sphere, but only when
terrific pressure is applied. What that proves  can't even begin to
guess.

ou said you eperimented on the first sphere, said Manning. ave you
made others?

uss rose from his chair.

Come on in, Greg, he said, and there was a grin on his face.  have
something you'll have to see to appreciate.

                                   

The apparatus was heavier and larger than the first in which uss had
created the sphere of energy. Fed by a powerful accumulator battery,
five power leads were aimed at it, centered in the space between four
great copper blocks.

uss's hand went out to the switch that controlled the power. Suddenly
the power beams flamed, changed from a dull glow into an intense, almost
intolerable brilliance. A dull grumble of power climbed up to a steady
wail.

The beams had changed color, were bluish now, the typical color of
ionied air. They were ust power beams, meeting at a common center, but
somehow they were ueer, too, for though they were capable of slashing
far out into space, they were stopped dead. Their might was pouring into
a common center and going no farther. A splash of intensely glowing
light rested over them, then began to rotate slowly as a motor somewhere
hummed softly, cutting through the mad roar and rumble of power that
surged through the laboratory.

The glowing light was spinning more swiftly now. A rotating field was
being established. The power beams began to wink, falling and rising in
intensity. The sphere seemed to grow, almost filling the space between
the copper blocks. t touched one and rebounded slightly toward another.
t etended, increased slightly. A terrible screaming ripped through the
room, drowning out the titanic din as the spinning sphere came in
contact with the copper blocks, as force and metal resulted in weird
friction.

With a shocking wrench the beams went dead, the scream cut off, the roar
was gone. A terrifying silence fell upon the room as soon as the
suddenly thunking relays opened automatically.

                                   

The sphere was gone n its place was a tenuous refraction that told
where it had been. That and a thin layer of perfectly reflective
copper ... colorless now, but Manning knew it was copper, for it
represented the continuation of the great copper blocks.

is mind felt as if it were racing in neutral, getting nowhere. Within
that sphere was the total energy that had been poured out by five
gigantic beams, turned on full, for almost a minute's time. Compressed
energy Energy enough to blast these mountains down to the primal rock
were it released instantly. Energy trapped and held by virtue of some
peculiarity of that little borderline between Force Fields  and .

uss walked across the room to a small electric truck with rubber
caterpillar treads, driven by a bank of portable accumulators.
Skillfully the scientist maneuvered it over to the other side of the
room, picked up a steel bar four inches in diameter and five feet long.
olding it by the handler's magnetic crane, he fied it firmly in the
armlike aws on the front of the machine, then moved the machine into a
position straddling the sphere of force.

With smashing momentum the iron aws thrust downward, driving the steel
bar into the sphere. There was a groaning crash as the handler came to a
halt, shuddering, with only eight inches of the bar buried in the
sphere. The stench of hot insulation filled the room while the electric
motor throbbed, the rubber treads creaked, the machine groaned and
strained, but the bar would go no farther.

uss shut off the machine and stood back.

That gives you an idea, he said grimly.

The trick now, Greg said, is to break down the field.

Without a word, uss reached for the power controls. A sudden roar of
thunderous fury and the beams leaped at the sphere ... but this time the
sphere did not materialie again. Again the wrench shuddered through the
laboratory, a wrench that seemed to distort space and time.

Then, as abruptly as it had come, it was gone. ut when it ended,
something gigantic and incomprehensibly powerful seemed to rush
soundlessly by ... something that was felt and sensed. t was like a
great noiseless, breathless wind in the dead of night that rushed by
them and through them, all about them in space and died slowly away.

ut the vanished steel did not reappear with the disappearance of the
sphere and the draining away of power. Almost grotesuely now, the
handler stood poised above the place where the sphere had been and in
its aws it held the bar. ut the end of the bar, the eight inches that
had been within the sphere, was gone. t had been sliced off so sharply
that it left a highly reflective concave mirror on the severed surface.

Where is it? demanded Manning. n that higher dimension?

uss shook his head. ou noticed that rushing sensation? That may have
been the energy of matter rushing into some other space. t may be the
key to the energy of matter

Gregory Manning stared at the bar. 'm staying with you, uss. 'm
seeing this thing through.

 knew you would, said uss.

Triumph flamed briefly in Manning's eyes. And when we finish, we'll
have something that will break nterplanetary. We'll smash their
stranglehold on the Solar System. e stopped and looked at age. ord,
uss, he whispered, do you realie what we'll have?

 think  do, Greg, the scientist answered soberly. Material energy
engines. ower so cheap that you won't be able to give it away. More
power than anybody could ever need.




CATE TEE


uss hunched over the keyboard set in the control room of the Comet
and stared down at the keys. The euation was set and ready. All he had
to do was tap that key and they would know, beyond all argument, whether
or not they had dipped into the awful heart of material energy whether,
finally, they held in their grasp the key to the release of energy that
would give the System power to spare.

is glance lifted from the keyboard, looked out the observation port.
Through the inkiness of space ran a faint blue thread, a tiny line that
stretched from the ship and away until it was lost in the darkness of
the void.

ne hundred thousand miles away, that thread touched the surface of a
steel ball bearing ... a speck in the immensity of space.

e thought about that little beam of blue. t took power to do that,
power to hold a beam tight and strong and steady through the stress of
one hundred thousand miles. ut it had to be that far away ... and they
had that power. From the bowels of the ship came the deep purr of it,
the angry, silky song of mighty engines throttled down.

e heard arry Wilson shuffling impatiently behind him, smelled the
acrid smoke that floated from the tip of Wilson's cigarette.

Might as well punch that key, uss, said Manning's cool voice. We
have to find out sooner or later.

uss's finger hovered over the key, steadied and held. When he punched
that key, if everything worked right, the energy in the tiny ball
bearing would be released instantaneously. The energy of a piece of
steel, weighing less than an ounce. ver that tight beam of blue would
flash the impulse of destruction....

is fingers plunged down.

Space flamed in front of them. For ust an instant the void seemed
filled with an angry, bursting fire that lapped with hungry tongues of
cold, blue light toward the distant planets. A flare so intense that it
was visible on the ovian worlds, three hundred million miles away. t
lighted the nightside of Earth, blotting out the stars and Moon,
sending astronomers scurrying for their telescopes, rating foothigh
streamers in the night editions.

Slowly uss turned around and faced his friend.

We have it, Greg, he said. We really have it. We've tested the
control formulas all along the line. We know what we can do.

We don't know it all yet, declared Greg. We know we can make it work,
but  have a feeling we haven't more than skimmed the surface
possibilities.

                                   

uss sank into a chair and stared about the room. They knew they could
generate alternating current of any freuency they chose by use of a
special collector apparatus. They could release radiant energy in almost
any uantity they desired, in any wavelength, from the longest radio to
the incredibly hard cosmics. The electrical power they could measure
accurately and easily by simple voltmeters and ammeters. ut radiant
energy was another thing. When it passed all hitherto known bonds, it
would simply fuse any instrument they might use to measure it.

ut they knew the power they generated. n one split second they had
burst the energy bonds of a tiny bit of steel and that energy had glared
briefly more hotly than the Sun.

Greg, he said, it isn't often you can say that any event was the
beginning of a new era. ou can with thisthe era of unlimited power.
t kind of scares me.

p until a hundred years ago coal and oil and oygen had been the main
power sources, but with the dwindling of the supply of coal and oil, man
had sought another way. e had turned back to the old dream of snatching
power direct from the Sun. n the year  atterson had perfected the
photocell. Then the Aleanderson accumulators made it possible to pump
the lifeblood of power to the far reaches of the System, and on Mercury
and enus, and to a lesser etent on Earth, great accumulator power
plants had sprung up, with nterplanetary, under the driving genius of
Spencer Chambers, gaining control of the market.

The photocell and the accumulator had spurred interplanetary trade and
settlement. ntil it had been possible to store Sunpower for the
driving of spaceships and for shipment to the outer planets, ships had
been driven by rocket fuel, and the struggling colonies on the outer
worlds had fought a bitter battle without the aid of ready power.

Coal and oil there were in plenty on the outer worlds, but one other
essential was lacking ... oygen. Coal on Mars, for instance, had to
burned under synthetic air pressures, like the old carburetor. The
result was inefficiency. A lot of coal burned, not enough power
delivered.

Even the photocells were inefficient when attempts were made to operate
them beyond the Earth that was the maimum distance for maimum Solar
efficiency.

uss dug into the pocket of his faded, scuffed leather acket and hauled
forth pipe and pouch. Thoughtfully he tamped the tobacco into the bowl.

Three months, he said. Three months of damn hard work.

eah, agreed Wilson, we sure have worked.

Wilson's face was haggard, his eyes red. e blew smoke through his
nostrils.

When we get back, how about us taking a little vacation? he asked.

uss laughed. ou can if you want to. Greg and  are keeping on.

We can't waste time, Manning said. Spencer Chambers may get wind of
this. e'd move all hell to stop us.

Wilson spat out his cigarette. Why don't you patent what you have? That
would protect you.

                                   

uss grinned, but it was a sour one.

o use, said Greg. Chambers would tie us up in a mile of legal red
tape. t would be ust like walking up and handing it to him.

ou guys go ahead and work, Wilson stated. 'm taking a vacation.
Three months is too damn long to stay out in a spaceship.

t doesn't seem long to me, said Greg, his tone cold and sharp.

o, thought uss, it hadn't seemed long. erhaps the hours had been
rough, the work hard, but he hadn't noticed. Sleep and food had come in
snatches. For three months they had worked in space, not daring to carry
out their eperiments on Earth ... frankly afraid of the thing they had.

e glanced at Manning.

The three months had left no mark upon him, no hint of fatigue or
strain. uss understood now how Manning had done the things he did. The
man was all steel and flame. othing could touch him.

We still have a lot to do, said Manning.

uss leaned back and puffed at his pipe.

es, there was a lot to do. Transmission problems, for instance. To
conduct away such terrific power as they knew they were capable of
developing would reuire copper or silver bars as thick as a man's
thigh, and even so at voltages capable of umping a twofoot spark gap.

bviously, a small machine such as they now had would be impractical. o
matter how perfectly it might be insulated, the atmosphere itself would
not be an insulator, with power such as this. And if one tried to
deliver the energy as a mechanical rotation of a shaft, what shaft could
transmit it safely and under control?

h, hell, uss burst out, let's get back to Earth.

                                   

arry Wilson watched the couple alight from the aerotai, walk up the
broad steps and pass through the magic portals of the Martian Club. e
could imagine what the club was like, the deference of the management,
the eotic atmosphere of the dining room, the ecellence of the long,
cold drinks served at the bar. Mysterious drinks concocted of
ingredients harvested in the ungles of enus, spiced with produce from
the irrigated gardens of Mars.

e puffed on the dangling cigarette and shuffled on along the airy
highwalk. elow and above him, all around him flowed the beauty and the
glamor, the bravery and the splendor of ew ork. The city's song was in
his ears, the surging noises that were its voice.

Two thousand feet above his head reared giant pinnacles of shining
metal, glinting in the noonday sun, architecture that bore the alien
stamp of other worlds.

Wilson turned around, stared at the Martian Club. A man needed money to
pass through those doors, to taste the drinks that slid across its bar,
to sit and watch its floor shows, to hear the music of its orchestras.

For a moment he stood, hesitating, as if he were trying to make up his
mind. e flipped away the cigarette, turned on his heel, walked briskly
to the automatic elevator which would take him to the lower levels.

There, on the third level, he entered a Mecho restaurant, sat down at a
table and ordered from the robot waiter, pushing ivorytipped buttons on
the menu before him.

e ate leisurely, smoked ferociously, thinking. ooking at his watch, he
saw that it was nearly two o'clock. e walked to the cashier machine,
inserted the metallic check with the correct change and received from
the clicking, chuckling register the disk that would let him out the
door.

Thank you, come again, the cashierrobot fluted.

on't mention it, growled Wilson.

utside the restaurant he walked briskly. Ten blocks away he came to a
building roofing four suare blocks. ver the massive doorway, set into
the beryllium steel, was a map of the Solar System, a map that served as
a cosmic clock, tracing the movement of the planets as they swung in
their long arcs around the Sun. The Solar System was straddled by
glowing, golden letters. They read: TEAETA G.

t was from here that Spencer Chambers ruled his empire built on power.

Wilson went inside.




CATE F


The new apparatus was set up, a machine that almost filled the
laboratory ... a giant, compact mass of heavy, solidly built metal work,
tied together by beams of girderlike construction. t was meant to stand
up under the hammering of unimaginable power, the stress of unknown
spatial factors.

Slowly, carefully, ussell age tapped keys on the control board,
setting up an euation. Sucking thoughtfully at his pipe, he checked and
rechecked them.

arry Wilson regarded him through suinted eyes.

What the hell is going to happen now? he asked.

We'll have to wait and see, uss answered. We know what we want to
happen, what we hope will happen, but we never can be sure. We are
working with conditions that are entirely new.

Sitting beside a table littered with papers, staring at the gigantic
machine before him, Gregory Manning said slowly: That thing simply has
to adapt itself to spaceship drive. There's everything there that's
needed for space propulsion. nlimited power from a minimum of fuel.
Splitsecond efficiency. Entire independence of any set condition,
because the stuff creates its own conditions.

e slowly wagged his head.

The secret is some place along the line, he declared.  feel that we
must be getting close to it.

uss walked from the control board to the table, picked up a sheaf of
papers and leafed through them. e selected a handful and shook them in
his fist.

 thought  had it here, he said. My math must have been wrong, some
factor that  didn't include in the euation.

ou'll keep finding factors for some time yet, Greg prophesied.

epulsion would have been the answer, said uss bitterly. And the
ord knows we have it. lenty of it.

Too much, observed Wilson, smoke drooling from his nostrils.

ot too much, corrected Greg. nefficient control. ou ump at
conclusions, Wilson.

The math didn't show that progressive action, said uss. t showed
repulsion, negative gravity that could be built up until it would shoot
the ship outside the Solar System within an hour's time. Faster than
light. We don't know how many times faster.

Forget it, advised Greg. The way it stands, it's useless. ou get
repulsion by progressive steps. A series of suares with one constant
factor. t wouldn't be any good for space travel. magine trying to use
it on a spaceship. ou'd start with a terrific olt. The acceleration
would fade and ust when you were recovering from the first olt, you'd
get a second one and that second one would iron you out. A spaceship
couldn't take it, let alone a human body.

                                   

Maybe this will do it, said Wilson hopefully.

Maybe, agreed uss. Anyhow we'll try it. Euation .

t might do the trick, said Greg. t's a new approach to the gravity
angle. The euation eplains the shifting of gravitational lines, the
changing and contortion of their direction. Twist gravity and you have a
perfect space drive. As good as negative gravity. etter, perhaps, more
easily controlled. Would make for more delicate, precise handling.

uss laid down the sheaf of papers, lit his pipe and walked to the
apparatus.

ere goes, he said.

is hand went out to the power lever, eased it in. With a roar the
material energy engine built within the apparatus surged into action,
sending a flow of power through the massive leads. The thunder mounted
in the room. The laboratory seemed to shudder with the impact.

Wilson, watching intently, cried out, a brief, chokedoff cry. A wave of
diiness engulfed him. The walls seemed to be falling in. The room and
the machine were blurring. uss, at the controls, seemed horribly
disointed. Manning was a caricature of a man, a weird, strange figure
that moved and gestured in the mad room.

Wilson fought against the diiness. e tried to take a step and the
floor seemed to leap up and meet his outstretched foot, throwing him off
balance. is cigarette fell out of his mouth, rolled along the floor.

uss was shouting something, but the words were distorted, loud one
instant, rising over the din of the apparatus, a mere whisper the net.
They made no sense.

There was a peculiar whistling in the air, a sound such as he had never
heard before. t seemed to come from far away, a high, thin shriek that
was torture in one's ears.

Giddy, seied with deathly nausea, Wilson clawed his way across the
floor, swung open the laboratory door and stumbled outdoors. e weaved
across the lawn and clung to a sun dial, panting.

e looked back at the laboratory and gasped in disbelief. All the trees
were bent toward the building, as if held by some mighty wind. Their
branches straining, every single leaf standing at rigid attention, the
trees were bending in toward the structure. ut there was no wind.

And then he noticed something else. o matter where the trees stood, no
matter in what direction from the laboratory, they all bent inward
toward the building ... and the whining, thundering, shrieking machine.

nside the laboratory an empty bottle crashed off a table and smashed
into a thousand fragments. The tinkling of the broken glass was a
silvery, momentary sound that protested against the blasting thrum of
power that shook the walls.

Manning fought along the floor to uss's side. uss roared in his ear:
Gravitational control Concentration of gravitational lines

The papers on the desk started to slide, slithering onto the floor,
danced a cray dervish across the room. iuids in the laboratory
bottles were climbing the sides of glass, instead of lying at rest
parallel with the floor. A chair skated, bucking and tipping craily,
toward the door.

                                   

uss erked the power lever back to ero. The power hum died. The
liuids slid back to their natural level, the chair tipped over and lay
still, papers fluttered gently downward.

The two men looked at one another across the few feet of floor space
between them. uss wiped beads of perspiration from his forehead with
his shirt sleeve. e sucked on his pipe, but it was dead.

Greg, uss said ubilantly, we have something better than
antigravity We have something you might call positive gravity ...
gravity that we can control. our grandfather nullified gravity. We've
gone him one better.

Greg gestured toward the machine. ou created an attraction center.
What else?

ut the center itself is not actually an attracting force. The fourth
dimension is mied up in this. We have a sort of fourthdimensional lens
that concentrates the lines of any gravitational force. Concentration in
the fourth dimension turns the force loose in three dimensions, but we
can take care of that by using mirrors of our antientropy. We can
arrange it so that it turns the force loose in only one dimension.

Greg was thoughtful for a moment. We can guide a ship by a series of
lenses, he declared at last. ut here's the really important thing.
That field concentrates the forces of gravity already present. Those
forces eist throughout all of space. There are gravitational lines
everywhere. We can concentrate them in any direction we want to. n
reality, we fall toward the body which originally caused the force of
gravitation, not to the concentration.

                                   

uss nodded. That means we can create a field immediately ahead of the
ship. The ship would fall into it constantly, with the concentration
moving on ahead. The field would tend to break down in proportion to the
strain imposed and a big ship, especially when you are building up
speed, would tend to enlarge it, open it up. ut the field could be kept
tight by supplying energy and we have plenty of that ... far more than
we'd ever need. We supply the energy, but that's only a small part of
it. The body emitting the gravitational force supplies the fulcrum that
moves us along.

t would operate beyond the planets, said Greg. t would operate
eually well anywhere in space, for all of space is filled with
gravitational stress. We could use gravitational bodies many light years
away as the driver of our ships.

A halfwild light glowed momentarily in his eyes.

uss, he said, we're going to put space fields to work at last.

e walked to the chair, picked it up and sat down in it.

We'll start building a ship, he stated, ust as soon as we know the
mechanics of this gravity concentration and control. uss, we'll build
the greatest ship, the fastest ship, the most powerful ship the Solar
System has ever known

                                   

amn, said uss, that thing's slipped again.

e glared at the offending nut. 'll put a lock washer on it this
time.

Wilson stepped toward the control board. From his perch on the
apparatus, uss motioned him away.

ever mind discharging the field, he said.  can get around it
somehow.

Wilson suinted at him. This tooth is near killing me.

Still got a toothache? asked uss.

ever got a wink of sleep last night.

ou better run down to Frisco and have it yanked out, suggested the
scientist. Can't have you laid up.

eah, that's right, agreed Wilson. Maybe  will. We got a lot to do.

uss reached out and clamped his wrench on the nut, uickly backed it
off and slipped on the washer. iciously he tightened it home. The
wrench stuck.

Gritting his teeth on the bit of his pipe, uss cursed soundlessly. e
yanked savagely at the wrench. t slipped from his hand, hung for a
minute on the nut and then plunged downward, falling straight into the
heart of the new force field they had developed.

uss froe and watched, his heart in his throat, mad thoughts in his
brain. n a flash, as the wrench fell, he remembered that they knew
nothing about this field. All they knew was that any matter introduced
in it suddenly acuired an acceleration in the dimension known as time,
with its normal constant of duration reduced to ero.

When that wrench struck the field, it would cease to eist ut
something else might happen, too, something entirely unguessable.

The wrench fell only a few feet, but it seemed to take long seconds as
uss watched, froen in fascination.

e saw it strike the hay glow that defined the limits of the field, saw
it floating down, as if its speed had been slowed by some dense medium.

n the instant that hay glow intensified a thousand timesbecame a
blinding sunburst uss ducked his head, shielded his eyes from the
terrible blast of light. A rending, shuddering thud seemed to echo ...
in space rather than in air ... and both field and wrench were gone

A moment passed, then another, and there was the heavy, solid clanging
thud of something striking metal. This time the thud was not in space,
but a commonplace noise, as if someone had dropped a tool on the floor
above.

uss turned around and stared at Wilson. Wilson stared back, his mouth
hanging open, the smoldering, cigarette dangling from his mouth.

Greg uss shouted, his cry shattering the silence in the laboratory.

A door burst open and Manning stepped into the main laboratory room, a
calculation pad in one hand, a pencil in the other.

What's the matter? he demanded.

We have to find my wrench

our wrench? Greg was puled. Can't you get another?

 dropped it into the field. ts timedimension was reduced to ero. t
became an 'instantaneous wrench'.

othing new in that, said Greg, unruffled.

ut there is, persisted uss. The field collapsed, you see. Maybe the
wrench was too big for it to handle. And when the field collapsed the
wrench gained a new timedimension.  heard it. We have to find it.

The three of them pounded up the stairs to the room where uss had heard
the thump. There was nothing on the floor. They searched the room from
end to end, then the other rooms. There was no wrench.

At the end of an hour Greg went back to the main laboratory, brought
back a portable fluoroscope.

Maybe this will do the trick, he announced bleakly.

                                   

t did. They found the wrench inside the space between the walls

uss stared at the shadow in the fluoroscope plate. ndeniably it was
the shadow of the wrench.

Fourth dimension, he said. Transported in time.

The muscles in Greg's cheeks were tensed, that old flame of ecitement
burning in his eyes, but otherwise his face was the mask of old, the
calm, almost terrible mask that had faced a thousand dangers.

ower and time, he corrected.

f we can control it, said uss.

on't worry. We can control it. And when we can, it's the biggest thing
we've got.

Wilson licked his lips, dredged a cigarette out of a pocket.

f you don't mind, he said, 'll hit for Frisco tonight. This tooth
of mine is getting worse.

Sure, can't keep an aching tooth, agreed uss, thinking of the wrench
while talking.

Can  take your ship? asked Wilson.

Sure, said uss.

ack in the laboratory they rebuilt the field, dropped little ball
bearings in it. The ball bearings disappeared. They found them
everywherein the walls, in tables, in the floor. Some, still eisting
in their new timedimension, hung in midair, invisible, intangible, but
there.

ours followed hours, with the sheet of data growing. Math machines
whirred and chuckled and clicked. Wilson departed for San Francisco with
his aching tooth. The other two worked on. y dawn they knew what they
were doing. ut of the chaos of happenstance they were finding rules of
order, certain formulas of behavior, euations of force.

The net day they tried heavier, more complicated things and learned
still more.

A radiogram, phoned from the nearest spaceport, forty miles distant,
informed them that Wilson would not be back for a few days. is tooth
was worse than he had thought, reuired an operation and treatment of
the aw.

ell, said uss, ust when he could be so much help.

With Wilson gone the two of them tackled the controlling device, labored
and swore over it. ut finally it was completed.

Slumped in chairs, utterly ehausted, they looked proudly at it.

With that, said uss, we can take an obect and transport it any
place we want. ot only that, we can pick up any obect from an
indefinite distance and bring it to us.

What a thing for a lay burglar, Greg observed sourly.

Worn out, they gulped sandwiches and scalding coffee, tumbled into bed.

                                   

The outdoor camp meeting was in full swing. The evangelist was in his
top form. The sinners' bench was crowded. Then suddenly, as the
evangelist paused for a moment's silence before he drove home an
important point, the music came. Music from the air. Music from
somewhere in the sky. The soft, heavenly music of a hymn. As if an
angels' chorus were singing in the blue.

The evangelist froe, one arm pointing upward, with inde finger ready
to sweep down and emphasie his point. The sinners kneeling at the bench
were petrified. The congregation was astounded.

The hymn rolled on, punctuated, backgrounded by deep celestial organ
notes. The clear voice of the choir swept high to a belllike note.

ehold shrieked the evangelist. ehold, a miracle Angels singing
for us neel neel and pray

obody stood.

                                   

Andy Mcntyre was drunk again. n the piteous glare of midmorning, he
staggered homeward from the poker party in the back of Steve Abram's
harness shop. The light revealed him to the scorn of the entire village.

At the corner of Elm and Third he ran into a maple tree. ncertainly he
backed away, intent on making another try. Suddenly the tree spoke to
him:

Alcohol is the scourge of mankind. t turns men into beasts. t robs
them of their brains, it shortens their lives ...

Andy stared, unable to believe what he heard. The tree, he had no doubt,
was talking to him personally.

The voice of the tree went on: ... takes the bread out of the mouths of
women and children. Fosters crime. Weakens the moral fiber of the
nation.

Stop screamed Andy. Stop,  tell you

The tree stopped talking. All he could hear was the whisper of wind
among its autumntinted leaves.

Suddenly running, Andy darted around the corner, headed home.

egad, he told himself, when trees start talkin' to you it's time to
lay off the bottle

                                   

n another town fifty miles distant from the one in which the tree had
talked to Andy Mcntyre, another miracle happened that same Sunday
morning.

oens of people heard the brone statue of the soldier in the courtyard
speak. The statue did not come to life. t stood as ever, a solid piece
of golden brone, in spots turned black and green by weather. ut from
its lips came words ... words that burned themselves into the souls of
those who heard. Words that ehorted them to defend the principles for
which many men had died, to grasp and hold high the torch of democracy
and liberty.

n somber bitterness, the statue called Spencer Chambers the greatest
threat to that liberty and freedom. For, the statue said, Spencer
Chambers and nterplanetary ower were waging an economic war, a
bloodless one, but ust as truly war as if there were cannons firing and
bombs eploding.

For a full five minutes the statue spoke and the crowd, growing by the
minute, stood dumbfounded.

Then silence fell over the courtyard. The statue stood as before,
unmoving, its timeless eyes staring out from under the ugly helmet, its
hands gripping the bayoneted rifle. A blue and white pigeon fluttered
softly down, alighted on the bayonet, looked the crowd over and then
flew to the courthouse tower.

                                   

ack in the laboratory, uss looked at Greg.

That radio trick gives me an idea, he said. f we can put a radio in
statues and trees without interfering with its operation, why can't we
do the same thing with a television set?

Greg started. Think of the possibilities of that he burst out.

Within an hour a complete television sending apparatus was placed within
the field and a receptor screen set up in the laboratory.

The two moved chairs in front of the screen and sat down. uss reached
out and pulled the switch of the field control. The screen came to life,
but it was only a gray blur.

t's traveling too fast, said Greg. Slow it down.

uss retarded the lever. When that thing's on full, it's almost
instantaneous. t travels in a time dimension and any speed slower than
instantaneity is a modification of that force field.

n the screen swam a panorama of the mountains, mile after mile of
snowcapped peaks and valleys ablae with the flames of autumn foliage.
The mountains faded away. There was desert now and then a city. uss
dropped the televisor set lower, down into a street. For half an hour
they sat comfortably in their chairs and watched men and women walking,
witnessed one dog fight, cruised slowly up and down, looking into
windows of homes, windowshopping in the business section.

There's ust one thing wrong, said Greg. We can see everything, but
we can't hear a sound.

We can fi that, uss told him.

e lifted the televisor set from the streets, brought it back across the
desert and mountains into the laboratory.

We have two practical applications now, said Greg. Space drive and
television spying.  don't know which is the best. o you realie that
with this television trick there isn't a thing that can be hidden from
us?

 believe we can go to Mars or Mercury or anywhere we want to with this
thing. t doesn't seem to have any particular limits. t handles
perfectly. ou can move it a fraction of an inch as easily as a hundred
miles. And it's fast. Almost instantaneous. ot uite, for even with
our acceleration within time, there is a slight lag.

y evening they had an audio apparatus incorporated in the set, had
wired the screen for sound.

et's put this to practical use, suggested Greg. There's a show at
the ew Mercury Theater in ew ork 've been wanting to see. et's
knock off work and take in that show.

ow, said uss, you really have an idea. The ticket scalpers are
charging a fortune, and it won't cost us a cent to get in




CATE FE


ine roots burned brightly in the fireplace, snapping and siling as
the blae caught and flamed on the resin. eep in an easy chair, Greg
Manning stretched his long legs out toward the fire and lifted his
glass, suinting at the flames through the amber drink.

There's something that's been worrying me a little, he said.  hadn't
told you about it because  figured it wasn't as serious as it looked.
Maybe it isn't, but it looks funny.

What's that? asked uss.

The stock market, replied Greg. There's something devilish funny
going on there. 've lost about a billion dollars in the last two
weeks.

A billion dollars? gasped uss.

Greg swirled the whiskey in his glass. on't sound so horrified. The
loss is all on paper. My stocks have gone down. Most of them cut in
half. Some even less than that. Martian rrigation is down to .  paid
 for it. t's worth .

ou mean something has happened to the market?

ot to the market. f that was it,  wouldn't worry. 've seen the
market go up and down. That's nothing to worry about. ut the market,
ecept for a slight depression, has behaved normally in these past two
weeks. t almost looks as if somebody was out to get me.

Who'd want to and why?

Greg sighed.  wish  knew.  haven't really lost a cent, of course. My
shares can't stay down for very long. The thing is that right now 
can't sell them even for what  paid for them. f  sold now 'd lose
that billion. ut as long as  don't have to sell, the loss is merely on
paper.

e sipped at the drink and stared into the fire.

f you don't have to, what are you worrying about? asked uss.

Couple of things.  put that stock up as collateral to get the cash to
build the spaceship. At present prices, it will take more securities
than  thought. f the prices continue to go down, 'll have the bulk of
my holdings tied up in the spaceship.  might even be forced to
liuidate some of it and that would mean an actual loss.

e hunched forward in the chair, stared at uss.

Another thing, he said grimly, is that  hate the idea of somebody
singling me out as a target. As if they were going to make a financial
eample of me.

And it sounds as if someone has, agreed uss.

Greg leaned back again, drained his glass and set it down.

t certainly does, he said.

utside, seen through the window beside the fireplace, the harvest moon
was a shield of silver hung in the velvet of the sky. A lonesome wind
moaned in the pines and under the eaves.

 got a report from elgium the other day, said Greg. The spaceship
is coming along. t'll be the biggest thing afloat in space.

The biggest and the toughest, said uss, and Greg nodded silent
agreement.

The ship itself was being manufactured at the great Space Works in
elgium, but other parts of it, apparatus, engines, gadgets of every
description, were being manufactured at other widely scattered points.
Anyone wondering what kind of ship the finished product would be would
have a hard time gathering the correct information, which, of course,
was the idea. The anyone they were guarding against was Spencer
Chambers.

                                   

We need a better television set, said uss. This one we have is all
right, but we need the best there is.  wonder if Wilson could get us
one in Frisco and bring it back.

 don't see why not, said Greg. Send him a radio.

uss stepped to the phone, called the spaceport and filed the message.

e always stays at the Greater Martian, he told Greg. We'll probably
catch him there.

                                   

Two hours later the phone rang. t was the spaceport.

That message you sent to Wilson, said the voice of the operator,
can't be delivered. Wilson isn't at the Greater Martian. The clerk said
he checked out for ew ork last night.

idn't he leave a forwarding address? asked uss.

Apparently not.

uss hung up the receiver, frowning. Wilson is in ew ork.

Greg looked up from a sheet of calculations.

ew ork, eh? he said and then went back to work, but a moment later
he straightened from his work. What would Wilson be doing in ew ork?

 wonder ... uss stopped and shook his head.

Eactly, said Greg. e glanced out of the window, considering, the
muscles in his cheeks knotting. uss, we both are thinking the same
thing.

 hate to think it, said uss evenly.  hate to think such a thing
about a man.

ne way to find out, declared Greg. e rose from the chair and walked
to the television control board, snapped the switch. uss took a chair
beside him. n the screen the mountains danced weirdly as the set
rocketed swiftly away and then came the glint of red and yellow desert.
lackness blanked out the screen as the set plunged into the ground,
passing through the curvature of the Earth's surface. The blackness
passed and fields and farms were beneath them on the screen, a green and
brown checkerboard with tiny white lines that were roads.

ew ork was in the screen now. Greg's hand moved the control and the
city rushed up at them, the spires speeding toward them like plunging
spears. own into the canyons plunged the set, down into the financial
district with its beetling buildings that hemmed in the roaring traffic.

Grimly, surely, Greg drove his strange machine through ew ork. Through
buildings, through shimmering planes, through men. ike an arrow the
television set sped to its mark and then Greg's hand snapped back the
lever and in the screen was a building that covered four whole blocks.
Above the entrance was the famous Solar System map and straddling the
map were the gleaming golden letters: TEAETA G.

ow we'll see, said Greg.

e heard the whistle of the breath in uss's nostrils as the television
set began to move, saw the tight grip uss had upon the chair arms.

The interior of the building showed on the screen as he drove the set
through steel and stone, offices and corridors and brief glimpses of
steel partitions, until it came to a door marked: SECE CAMES,
ESET.

Greg's hand twisted the control slightly and the set went through the
door, into the office of Spencer Chambers.

Four men were in the roomChambers himself Craven, the scientist
Arnold Grant, head of nterplanetary's publicity department, and arry
Wilson

Wilson's voice came out of the screen, a frantic, almost terrified
voice.

've told you all  know. 'm not a scientist. 'm a mechanic. 've
told you what they're doing.  can't tell you how they do it.

Arnold Grant leaned forward in his chair. is face was twisted in fury.

There were plans, weren't there? he demanded. There were euations
and formulas. Why didn't you bring us some of them?

Spencer Chambers raised a hand from the desk, waved it toward Grant.
The man has told us all he knows. bviously, he can't be any more help
to us.

ou told him to go back and see if he couldn't find something else,
didn't you? asked Grant.

es,  did, Chambers told him. ut apparently he couldn't find it.

 tried, pleaded Wilson. erspiration stood out on his forehead. The
cigarette in his mouth was limp and dead. ne of them was always there.
 never could get hold of any papers.  asked uestions, but they were
too busy to answer. And  couldn't ask too much, because then they would
have suspected me.

o, you couldn't do that, commented Craven with an open sneer.

                                   

n the laboratory uss pounded the arm of his chair with a clenched
fist. The rat sold us out

Greg said nothing, but his face was stony and his eyes were
crystalhard.

n the screen Chambers was speaking to Wilson. o you think you could
find something out if you went back again?

Wilson suirmed in his chair.

'd rather not. is voice sounded like a whimper. 'm afraid they
suspect me now. 'm afraid of what they'd do if they found out.

That's his conscience, breathed uss in the laboratory.  never
suspected him.

e's right about one thing, though, Greg said. e'd better not come
back.

Chambers was talking again: ou realie, of course, that you haven't
been much help to us. ou have only warned us that another kind of power
generation is being developed. ou've set us on our guard, but other
than that we're no better off than we were before.

Wilson bristled, like a cowardly animal backed into a corner.  told
you what was going on. ou can be ready for it now.  can't help it if 
couldn't find out how all them things worked.

ook here, said Chambers.  made a bargain with you and  keep my
bargains.  told you  would pay you twenty thousand dollars for the
information you gave me when you first came to see me.  told you 'd
pay you for any further additional information you might give. Also 
promised you a ob with the company.

Watching the financier, Wilson licked his lips. That's right, he said.

Chambers reached out and pulled a checkbook toward him, lifted a pen
from its holder. 'm paying you the twenty thousand for the warning.
'm not paying you a dime more, because you gave me no other
information.

Wilson leaped to his feet, started to protest.

Sit down, said Chambers coldly.

ut the ob ou said you'd give me a ob

Chambers shook his head.  wouldn't have a man like you in my
organiation. f you were a traitor to one man, you would be to
another.

ut ... but ... Wilson started to obect and then sat down, his face
twisted in something that came very close to fear.

Chambers ripped the check out of the book, waved it slowly in the air to
dry it. Then he arose and held it out to Wilson, who reached out a
trembling hand and took it.

And now, said Chambers, good day, Mr. Wilson.

For a moment Wilson stood uncertain, as if he intended to speak, but
finally he turned, without a word, and walked through the door.

                                   

n the laboratory uss and Greg looked at one another.

Twenty thousand, said Greg. Why, that was worth millions.

t was worth everything Chambers had, said uss, because it's the
thing that's going to wreck him.

Their attention snapped back to the screen.

Chambers was hunched over his desk, addressing the other two.

ow, gentlemen, he asked, what are we to do?

Craven shrugged his shoulders. There was a puled frown in the eyes
back of the thicklensed glasses. We haven't much to go on. Wilson
doesn't know a thing about it. e hasn't the brain to grasp even the
most fundamental ideas back of the whole thing.

Chambers nodded. The man knew the mechanical setup perfectly, but that
was all.

've constructed the apparatus, said Craven. t's astoundingly
simple. Almost too simple to do the things Wilson said it would do. e
drew plans for it, so clear that it was easy to duplicate the apparatus.
e himself checked the machine and says it is the same as age and
Manning have. ut there are thousands of possible combinations for
hookups and control board settings. Too many to try to go through and
hit upon the right answer. ecause, you see, one slight adustment in
any one of a hundred adustments might do the trick ... but which of
those adustments do you have to make? We have to have the formulas, the
euations, before we can even move.

e seemed to remember a few things, said Grant hopefully. Certain
rules and formulas.

Craven flipped both his hands angrily. Worse than nothing, he
eploded. What age and Manning have done is so far in advance of
anything that anyone else has even thought about that we are completely
at sea. They're working with space fields, apparently, and we haven't
even scratched the surface in that branch of investigation. We simply
haven't got a thing to go on.

                                   

o chance at all? asked Chambers.

Craven shook his head slowly.

At least you could try, snapped Grant.

ow, wait, Chambers snapped back. ou seem to forget r. Craven is
one of the best scientists in the world today. 'm relying on him.

Craven smiled.  can't do anything with what age and Manning have, but
 might try something of my own.

y all means do so, urged Chambers. e turned to Grant.  observed
you have carried out the plans we laid. Martian rrigation hit a new low
today.

Grant grinned. t was easy. ust a hint here and there to the right
people.

Chambers looked down at his hands, slowly closing into fists. We have
to stop them some way, any way at all. eep up the rumors. We'll make
it impossible for Greg Manning to finance this new invention. We'll take
away every last dollar he has.

e glared at the publicity man. ou understand?

es, sir, said Grant,  understand perfectly.

All right, said Chambers. And your ob, Craven, is to either develop
what age has found or find something we can use in competition.

Craven growled angrily. What happens if your damn rumors can't ruin
Manning? What if  can't find anything?

n that case, said Chambers, there are other ways.

ther ways?

Chambers suddenly smiled at them.  have a notion to call Stutsman back
to Earth.

Craven drummed his fingers idly on the arm of his chair. es,  guess
you do have other ways, he said.

                                   

Greg's hand snapped the switch and the screen suddenly was blank as the
televisor set returned instantly to the laboratory.

That eplains a lot of things, he said. Among them what has happened
to my stocks.

uss sat in his chair, numbed. That little weakkneed, ratting traitor,
Wilson. e'd sell his mother for a new tendollar bill.

We know, said Greg, and Chambers doesn't know we know. We'll follow
every move he makes. We'll know every one of his plans.

acing up and down the room, he was already planning their campaign.

There are still a few things to do, he added. A few possibilities we
may have overlooked.

ut will we have time? asked uss.

 think so. Chambers is going to go slow. The gamble is too big to risk
any slip. e doesn't want to get in bad with the law. There won't be any
strongarm stuff ... not until he recalls Stutsman from Callisto.

e paused in midstride, stood planted solidly on the floor.

When Stutsman gets into the game, he said, all hell will break
loose.

e took a deep breath.

ut we'll be ready for it then




CATE S


f we can get television reception with this apparatus of ours, asked
Greg, what is to prevent us from televising? Why can't we send as well
as receive?

uss drew doodles on a calculation sheet. We could. ust something else
to work out. ou must remember we're working in a fourdimensional
medium. That would complicate matters a little. ot like working in
three dimensions alone. t would ...

e stopped. The pencil fell from his finger and he swung around slowly
to face Manning.

What's the matter now? asked Greg.

ook, said uss ecitedly. We're working in four dimensions. And if
we televised through four dimensions, what would we get?

Greg wrinkled his brow. Suddenly his face relaed. ou don't mean we
can televise in three dimensions, do you?

That's what it should work out to, declared uss. e swung back to the
table again, picked up his pencil and otted down euations. e looked
up from the sheet. Threedimensional television he almost whispered.

Something new again, commented Greg.

'll say it's new

uss reached out and erked a calculator toward him. apidly he set up
the euations, pressed the tabulator lever. The machine gurgled and
chuckled, clicked out the result. ending over to read it, uss sucked
in his breath.

t's working out right, he said.

That'll mean new euipment, lots of it, Greg pointed out. Wilson's
gone, damn him. Who's going to help us?

We'll do it ourselves, said uss. When we're the only ones here, we
can be sure there won't be any leak.

t took hours of work on the math machines, but at the end of that time
uss was certain of his ground.

ow we go to work, he said, gleefully.

n a week's time they had built a triple televisor, but simplifications
of the standard commercial set gave them a mechanism that weighed little
more and was far more efficient and accurate.

uring the time the work went on they maintained a watch over both the
office of Spencer Chambers and the laboratory in which r. erbert
Craven worked  hours a day. nseen, unsuspected, they were silent
companions of the two men during many hours. They read what the men
wrote, read what was written to them, heard what they said, saw how they
acted. oing so, the pair in the high mountain laboratory gained a deep
insight into the characters of unsuspecting uarries.

oth utterly ruthless, declared Greg. ut apparently men who are
sincere in thinking that the spoils belong to the strong. Strange,
almost outdated men. ou can't help but like Chambers. e's good enough
at heart. e has his pet charities. e really,  believe, wants to help
the people. And  think he actually believes the best way to do it is to
gain a dictatorship over the Solar System. That ambition rules
everything in his life. t has hardened him and strengthened him. e
will crush ruthlessly, without a single ualm, anything that stands in
his path. That's why we'll have a fight on our hands.

                                   

Craven seemed to be making little progress. They could only guess at
what he was trying to develop.

 think, said uss, he's working on a collector field to suck in
radiant energy. f he really gets that, it will be something worth
having.

For hours Craven sat, an intent, untidy, unkempt man, sunk deep in the
cushions of an easy chair. is face was calm, with relaed aw and eyes
that seemed vacant. ut each time he would rouse himself from the chair
to pencil new notations on the pads of paper that littered his desk. ew
ideas, new approaches.

The triple televisor was completed ecept for one thing.

Sound isn't so easy, said uss. f we could only find a way to
transmit it as well as light.

isten, said Greg, why don't you try a condenser speaker.

A condenser speaker?

Sure, the gadget developed way back in the s. t hasn't been used
for years to my knowledge, but it might do the trick.

uss grinned broadly. ell, why didn't  think of that? ere 've been
racking my brain for a new approach, a new wrinkle ... and eactly what
 wanted was at hand.

Should work, declared Greg. ust the opposite of a condenser
microphone. nstead of radiating sound waves mechanically, it radiates a
changing electric field and this field becomes audible directly within
the ear. Even yet no one seems to understand ust how it works, but it
does ... and that's good enough.

 know, said uss. t really makes no sound. n other words it
creates an electric field that doubles for sound. t ought to be ust
the thing because nothing can stop it. Metal shielding can,  guess, if
it's thick enough, but it's got to be pretty damn thick.

t took time to set the mechanism up. eady, the massive apparatus,
within which glowed a larger and more powerful force field, was operated
by two monstrous material energy engines. The controls were euipped
with clockwork drives, designed so that the motion of the Earth could be
nullified completely and automatically for work upon outlying planets.

                                   

uss stood back and looked at it. Stand in front of that screen, Greg,
he said, and we'll try it on you.

Greg stepped in front of the screen. The purr of power came on.
Suddenly, materialiing out of the air, came Greg's proection. ay and
undefined at first, it rapidly assumed apparent solidity. Greg waved his
arm the image moved its arm.

uss left the controls and walked across the laboratory to inspect the
image. Eamined from all sides, it looked solid. uss walked through
it and felt nothing. There was nothing there. t was ust a
threedimensional image. ut even from two feet away, it was as if the
man himself stood there in all the actuality of flesh and blood.

ello, uss, the image whispered. t held out a hand. Glad to see you
again.

aughing, uss thrust out his hand. t closed on nothing in midair, but
the two men appeared to shake hands.

They tested the machine that afternoon. Their images strode above the
trees, apparently walking on thin air. Gigantic replicas of Greg stood
on a faraway mountain top and shouted with a thunderous voice. Smaller
images, no more than two inches high, shinnied up a table leg.

Satisfied, they shut off the machine.

That's one of the possibilities you mentioned, suggested uss.

Greg nodded grimly.

                                   

An autumn gale pelted the windows with driving rain, and a wild, wet
wind howled through the pines outside. The fire was leaping and flaring
in the fireplace.

eep in his chair, uss stared into the flame and puffed at his pipe.

The factory wants more money on the spaceship, said Greg from the
other chair.  had to put up some more shares as collateral on a new
loan.

Market still going down? asked uss.

ot the market, replied Greg. My stocks. All of them hit new lows
today.

uss dragged at the pipe thoughtfully. 've been thinking about that
stock business, Greg.

So have , but it doesn't seem to do much good.

ook, said uss slowly, what planets have echanges?

All of them ecept Mercury. The ovian echange is at anthoor. There's
even one out at luto. ust mining and chemical shares listed, though.

uss did not reply. Smoke curled up from his pipe. e was staring into
the fire.

Why do you ask? Greg wanted to know.

ust something stirring around in my mind.  was wondering where
Chambers does most of his trading.

anthoor now, said Greg. sed to do it on enus. The listing is
larger there. ut since he took over the ovian confederacy, he switched
his business to it. The transaction ta is lower. e saw to that.

And the same shares are listed on the Callisto market as on the ew
ork boards?

aturally, said Greg, only not as many.

uss watched the smoke from his pipe. ow long does it take light to
travel from Callisto to Earth?

Why, about  minutes,  guess. Somewhere around there. Greg sat
upright. Say, what's light got to do with this?

A lot, said uss. All commerce is based on the assumption that light
is instantaneous, but it isn't. All business, anywhere throughout the
Solar System, is based on Greenwich time. When a noon signal sent out
from Earth reaches Mars, it's noon there, but as a matter of fact, it is
actually  minutes or so past noon. When the same signal reaches
Callisto, the correct time for the chronometer used in commerce would be
noon when it is really a uarter to one. That system simplifies things.
oes away with varying times. And it has worked all right so far because
there has been, up to now, nothing that could go faster than light. o
news can travel through space, no message, no signal can be sent at any
speed greater than that. So everything has been fine.

Greg had come out of the chair, was standing on his feet, the glow of
the blae throwing his athletic figure into bold relief. That calm
eterior had been stripped from him now. e was ecited.

 see what you are getting at We have something that is almost
instantaneous

Almost, said uss. ot uite. There's a time lag somewhere. ut it
isn't noticeable ecept over vast distances.

ut it would beat ordinary light signals to Callisto. t would beat
them there by almost  minutes.

Almost, uss agreed. Maybe a split second less.

Greg strode up and down in front of the fireplace like a caged lion. y
heaven, he said, we've got Chambers where we want him. We can beat the
stock uotations to Callisto. With that advance knowledge of what the
board is doing in ew ork, we can make back every dime 've lost. We
can take Mr. Chambers to the cleaners

uss grinned. Eactly, he said. We'll know  minutes in advance of
the other traders what the market will be. et's see Chambers beat
that.




CATE SEE


en Wrail was taking things easy. Stretched out in his chair, with his
cigar lit and burning satisfactorily, he listened to a radio program
broadcast from Earth.

Through the window beside him, he could look out of his skyscraper
apartment over the domed city of anthoor. ooming in the sky, slightly
distorted by the heavy uart of the distant dome, was massive upiter,
a scarlet ball tinged with orange and yellow. verwhelmingly luminous,
monstrously large, it filled a large portion of the visible sky, a sight
that brought millions of tourists to the ovian moons each year, a sight
that even the oldtimers still must stare at, drawn by some unfathomable
fascination.

en Wrail stared at it now, puffing at his cigar, listening to the
radio. An aweinspiring thing, a looming planet that seemed almost ready
to topple and crash upon this airless, frigid world.

Wrail was an oldtimer. For thirty yearsEarth yearshe had made his
home in anthoor. e had seen the city grow from a dinky little mining
camp enclosed by a small dome to one that boasted half a million
population. The dome that now covered the city was the fourth one. Four
times, like the nautilus, the city had outgrown its shell, until today
it was the greatest domed city in the Solar System. Where life had once
been cheap and where the scum of the system had held rendevous, he had
seen anthoor grow into a city of dignity, capital of the ovian
confederacy.

e had helped build that confederacy, had been elected a member of the
constitution commission, had helped create the government and for over a
decade had helped to make its laws.

ut now ... en Wrail spat angrily and stuffed the cigar back in his
mouth again, taking a fresh and fearsome grip. ow everything had
changed. The ovian worlds today were held in bond by Spencer Chambers.
The government was in the hands of his henchmen. uly elected, of
course, but in an election held under the unspoken threat that
nterplanetary ower would withdraw, leaving the moons circling the
great planet without heat, air, energy. For the worlds of the ovian
confederacy, every single one of them, depended for their life upon the
accumulators freighted outward from the Sun.

Talk of revolt was in the air, but, lacking a leader, it would get
nowhere. ohn Moore Mallory was imprisoned on one of the prison
spaceships that plied through the Solar System. Mallory, months ago, had
been secretly transferred from the Callisto prison to the spaceship, but
in a week's time the secret had been spread in angry whispers. f there
had been riots and bloodshed, they would have been to no purpose. For
revolution, even if successful, would gain nothing. t would merely goad
nterplanetary ower into withdrawing, refusing to service the domed
cities on the moons.

                                   

en Wrail stirred restlessly in his chair. The cigar had gone out. The
radio program blared unheard. is eyes still looked out the window
without seeing upiter.

amn, said en Wrail. Why did he have to go and spoil an evening
thinking about this damned political situation? espite his part in the
building of the confederacy, he was a businessman, not a politician.
Still, it hurt to see something torn down that he had helped to build,
though he knew that every pioneering strike in history had been taken
over by shrewd, ruthless, powerful operators. nowing that should have
helped, but it didn't. e and the other ovian pioneers had hoped it
wouldn't happen and, of course, it had.

en Wrail, said a voice in the room.

Wrail swung around, away from the window.

Manning he yelled, and the man in the center of the room grinned
bleakly at him. ow did you come in without me hearing you? When did
you get here?

'm not here, said Greg. 'm back on Earth.

ou're what? asked Wrail blankly. That's a pretty silly statement,
isn't it, Manning? r did you decide to loosen up and pull a gag now and
then?

 mean it, said Manning. This is ust an image of me. My body is back
on Earth.

ou mean you're dead? ou're a ghost?

The grin widened, but the face was bleak as ever.

o, en, 'm ust alive as you are. et me eplain. This is a
television image of me. Threedimensional television.  can travel
anywhere like this.

Wrail sat down in the chair again.  don't suppose there'd be any use
trying to shake hands with you.

o use, agreed Manning's image. There isn't any hand.

or asking you to have a chair?

Manning shook his head.

Anyhow, said Wrail, 'm damn glad to see youor think  see you. 
don't know which. Figure you can stay and talk with me a while?

                                   

Certainly, said Manning. That is what  came for.  want to ask your
help.

isten, declared Wrail, you can't be on Earth, Manning.  say
something to you and you answer right back. That isn't possible. ou
can't hear anything  say until  minutes after  say it, and then 'd
have to wait another  minutes to hear your answer.

That's right, agreed the image, if you insist upon talking about the
velocity of light. We have something better than that.

We?

ussell age and myself. We have a twoway television apparatus that
works almost instantaneously. To all purposes, so far as the distance
between Earth and Callisto is concerned, it is instantaneous.

Wrail's aw fell. Well,  be damned. What have you two fellows been up
to now?

A lot, said Manning laconically. For one thing we are out to bust
nterplanetary ower. ust them wide open. ear that, Wrail?

Wrail stared in stupefaction. Sure,  hear. ut  can't believe it.

All right then, said Manning grimly, we'll give you proof. What
could you do, en, if we told you what was happening on the stock market
in ew ork ... without you having to wait the  minutes it takes the
uotations to get here?

Wrail sprang to his feet. What could  do? Why,  could run the pants
off every trader in the echange  could make a billion a minute e
stopped and looked at the image. ut this isn't like you. This isn't
the way you'd do things.

 don't want you to hurt anyone but Chambers, said Manning. f
somebody else gets in the way, of course they have to take the rap along
with him. ut  do want to give Chambers a licking. That's what  came
here to see you about.

y eaven, Greg, 'll do it, said Wrail. e stepped uickly forward,
held out his hand to close the deal, and encountered only air.

Manning's image threw back its head and laughed.

That's your proof, en. Good enough?

'll say it is, said Wrail shakily, looking down at the solidseeming
hand that his own had gone right through.

                                   

ovember , , was a day long remembered in financial circles
throughout the Solar System. The anthoor market opened easy with little
activity. Then a few stocks made fractional gains. Mining dropped
fractionally. Martian rrigation still was uneplainably low, as was
luto Chemical and Asteroid Mining.

Trading through two brokers, en Wrail bought , shares of enus
Farms, nc. when the market opened at . A few minutes later they
bought , shares of Spacesuits td. at . The farm stocks
dropped off a point. Spacesuits gained a point. Then suddenly both rose.
n the second hour of trading the enus stocks had boomed a full five
points and Wrail sold. Ten minutes later they sagged. At the end of the
day they were off two points from the opening. n late afternoon Wrail
threw his , shares of Spacesuits on the market, sold them at an
even . efore the close they had dropped back with a gain of only
half a point over the opening.

Those were only two transactions. There were others. Spaceship
Fabrication climbed three points before it fell and Wrail cashed in on
that. Mercury Metals rose two points and crashed back to close with a
full point loss. Wrail sold ust before the break. e had realied a
cool half million in the day's trade.

The net day it was a million and then the man who had always been a
safe trader, who had always played the conservative side of the market,
apparently sure of his ground now, plunged deeper and deeper. t was
uncanny. Wrail knew when to buy and when to sell. ther traders watched
closely, followed his lead. e threw them off by using different brokers
to disguise his transactions.

ectic day followed hectic day. en Wrail did not appear on the floor.
Calls to his office netted eactly nothing. Mr. Wrail was not in. So
sorry.

is brokers, well paid, were closemouthed. They bought and sold. That
was all.

Seated in his office, en Wrail was busy watching two television screens
before him. ne showed the board in the ew ork echange. n the other
was the image of Gregory Manning, hunched in a chair in age's mountain
laboratory back on Earth. And before Greg likewise were two screens, one
showing the ew ork echange board, the other trained on en Wrail's
office.

That Tourist stuff looks good, said Greg. Why not buy a block of it?
 happen to know that Chambers owns a few shares. e'll be dabbling in
it.

en Wrail grinned. t's made a couple of points, hasn't it? t's

They lapsed into silence, watching the board in ew ork.

ou know, Greg, said en finally,  really didn't believe all this
was true until  saw those credit certificates materialie on my desk.

Simple, grunted Greg. This thing we've got can take anything any
place.  could reach out there, grab you up and have you down here in a
split second.

en sucked his breath in between his teeth. 'm not doubting anything
any more. ou sent me half a billion two days ago. t's more than

e picked up the phone again and spoke to his broker on the other end.

The real furor came on the anthoor floor when Wrail cornered Titan
Copper. Striking swiftly, he purchased the stock in huge blocks. The
shares rocketed as the echanges throughout the System were thrown into
an uproar. nder the cover of the ecitement he proceeded to corner
Spacesuits td. Spacesuits oomed.

For two days the main echanges on four worlds were in a freny as
traders watched the shares climb swiftly. perators representing
nterplanetary ower made offerings. o takers were reported. The shares
climbed.

Within one hour, however, the entire Wrail holdings in both stocks were
dumped on the market. The nterplanetary ower traders, frantic over the
prospect of losing control of the two important issues, bought heavily.
The price plummeted.

Spencer Chambers lost three billion or more on the deal. vernight en
Wrail had become a billionaire many times over. Greg Manning added to
his own fortune.

We have enough, said Greg. We've given Chambers what he had coming to
him. et's call it off.

Glad to, agreed en. t was ust too damned easy.

e seeing you, en.

rop in for an evening.

That's an invitation, said Greg. t's easy with this threedimension
stuff.

e reached out a hand, snapped a control. The screens in Wrail's office
went dead.

Wrail reached for a cigar, lit it carefully. e leaned back in his
chair, put his feet on the desk.

A giant cylindrical hull of finest beryl steel, the ship loomed in the
screen. A mighty ship, braced into absolute rigidity by monster cross
beams of shining steel. Glowing under the blaing lamps that lighted the
scene, it towered into the shadows of the factory, dwarfing the
scurrying workmen who swarmed over it.

She's a beauty, said uss, puffing at his pipe.

Greg nodded agreement. They're working on her day and night to get her
finished. We may need it some day and need it in a hurry. f Chambers
really gets that machine of his to rolling, space will be the only place
big enough to hide in.

e chuckled, a grim chuckle, deep in his throat.

ut we won't have to hide long. ust until we get organied and then
will come the time when we'll call for the showdown. Chambers will have
to spread his cards.

uss snapped the television switch and the screen went blank. The
laboratory suddenly was a place of ueer lights and shadows, bulging
with grotesue machines, with sprawling apparatus, a place that hinted
darkly of vast power and mighty forces.

The scientist sat up in his chair. We've come a long way, Greg. A long,
long way. We have the greatest power man has ever known we have an
almost incomprehensible space drive we have threedimensional
television.

And, said Greg dryly, we took Chambers to the cleaners on the
market.

They sat in silence. Greg smelled the smoke from uss's pipe, mied with
the taint of lubricant and the faint lingering scent of ionied air.

We mustn't underrate Chambers, however, he declared. The man made one
mistake. e underrated us. We can't repeat his mistake. e is dangerous
all the time. e will stop at nothing. ot even murder.

e's going easy now, said uss. e's hoping Craven can find something
that will either eual our stuff or beat it. ut Craven isn't having any
luck. e's still driving himself on the radiation theory, but he doesn't
seem to make much headway.

f he got it, ust what would it mean?

lenty. With that he could turn all radiations in space to work. The
cosmics, heat, light, everything. Space is full of radiation.

f it hadn't been for Wilson, Greg said, his voice a snarl, we
wouldn't have to be worrying about Chambers. Chambers wouldn't know
until we were ready to let him know.

Wilson eaculated uss, suddenly leaning forward.  had forgotten
about Wilson. What do you say we try to find him?

                                   

arry Wilson sat at his table in the Martian Club and watched the eotic
Martian dance, performed by nearnude girls. Smoke trailed up laily
from his drooping cigarette as he watched through suinted eyes. There
was something about the dance that got under Wilson's skin.

The music rose, then fell to whispering undertones and suddenly,
unepectedly, crashed and stopped. The girls were running from the
floor. A wave of smooth, polite applause rippled around the tables.

Wilson sighed and reached for his wine glass. e crushed the cigarette
into a tray and sipped his wine. e glanced around the room, scanning
the bobbing, painted faces of the nightthe great, the neargreat, the
nearenoughtotouchthegreat. rokers and businessmen, artists and
writers and actors. There were others, too, ueer nightlife shadows
that no one knew much about, or that one heard too much about ... the
playboys and the ladies of family and fortune, correctly attired men,
gorgeously, sleekly attired women.

Andarry Wilson. The waiters called him Mr. Wilson. e heard people
whispering about him asking who he was. is soul soaked it in and cried
for more. Good food, good drinks, the pastels of the walls, the soft
lights and weird, eotic music. The cold but colorful correctness of it
all.

ust two months ago he had stood outside the club, a stranger in the
city, a mechanic from a little outoftheway laboratory, a man who was
paid a pittance for his skill. e had stood outside and watched his
employers walk up the steps and through the magic doors. e had watched
in bitterness....

ut now

The orchestra was striking up a tune. A blonde nodded at him from a
nearby table. Solemnly, with the bu of wine in his brain and its
hotness in his blood, he returned the nod.

Someone was speaking to him, calling him by name. e looked around, but
there was no one looking at him now. And once again, through that flow
of music, through the hum of conversation, through the buing of his
own brain, came the voice, cold and sharp as steel:

arry Wilson

t sent a shudder through him. e reached for the wine glass again, but
his hand stopped halfway to the stem, paused and trembled at what he
saw.

                                   

For there was a gray vagueness in front of him, a sort of shimmer of
nothingness, and out of that shimmer materialied a pencil.

As he watched, in stricken terror, the point of the pencil dropped to
the tablecloth and slowly, precisely, it started to move. e stared,
hypnotied, unbelieving, with the fingers of madness probing at his
brain. The pencil wrote:

    Wilson, you sold me out.

The man at the table tried to speak, tried to shriek, but his tongue and
throat were dry and only harsh breath rattled in his mouth.

The pencil moved on mercilessly:

    ut you will pay. o matter where you go,  will find you. ou
    cannot hide from me.

The pencil slowly lifted its point from the table and suddenly was gone,
as if it had never been. Wilson, eyes wide and filled with terrible
fear, stared at the black words on the cloth.

    Wilson, you sold me out. ut you will pay. o matter where you go, 
    will find you. ou cannot hide from me.

The music pulsated in the room, the hum of conversation ran like an
undertone, but Wilson did not hear. is entire consciousness was
centered on the writing, the letters and the words that filled his soul
with dread.

Something seemed to snap within him. The cold wind of terror reached out
and struck at him. e staggered from the chair. is hand swept the wine
glass from the table and it shattered into chiming shards.

They can't do this to me he shrieked.

There was a silence in the room a silence of terrible accusation.
Everyone was staring at him. Eyebrows raised.

                                   

A waiter was at his elbow. o you feel ill, sir?

And then, on unsteady feet, he was being led away. ehind him he heard
the music once again, heard the rising hum of voices.

Someone set his hat on his head, was holding his coat. The cold air of
the night struck his face and the doors sighed closed behind him.

'd take it easy going down the step, sir, counseled the doorman.

An aerotai driver held open the door of the cab and saluted.

Where to, sir?

Wilson stumbled in and stammered out his address. The tai droned into
the traffic lane.

ands twitching, Wilson fumbled with the key, took minutes to open the
door into his apartment. Finally the lock clicked and he pushed open the
door. is uesting finger found the wall switch. ight flooded the room.

Wilson heaved a sigh of relief. e felt safe here. This place belonged
to him. t was his home, his retreat....

A low laugh, hardly more than a chuckle, sounded behind him. e whirled
and for a moment, blinking in the light, he saw nothing. Then something
stirred by one of the windows, gray and vague, like a sheet of moving
fog.

As he watched, shrinking back against the wall, the grayness deepened,
took the form of a man. And out of that mistiness a face was etched, a
face that had no single line of humor in it, a bleak face with the fire
of anger in the eyes.

Manning shrieked Wilson. Manning e wheeled and sprinted for the
door, but the gray figure moved, too ... incredibly fast, as if it were
windblown vapor, and barred his path to the door.

Why are you running away? Manning's voice mocked. Certainly you
aren't afraid of me.

ook, Wilson whimpered,  didn't think of what it meant.  ust was
tired of working the way age made me work. Tired of the little salary 
got.  wanted money.  was hungry for money.

So you sold us out, said Manning.

o, cried Wilson,  didn't think of it that way.  didn't stop to
think.

Think now, then, said Manning gravely. Think of this. o matter where
you are, no matter where you go, no matter what you do, 'll always be
watching you, 'll never let you rest. 'll never give you a minute's
peace.

lease, pleaded Wilson. lease, go away and leave me. 'll give you
back the money ... there's some of it left.

ou sold out for twenty thousand, said Manning. ou could have gotten
twenty million. Chambers would have paid that much to know what you
could tell him, because it was worth twenty billion.

Wilson's breath was coming in panting gasps. e dropped his coat and
backed away. The back of his knees collided with a chair and he folded
up, sat down heavily, still staring at the gray mistiness that was a
man.

Think of that, Wilson, Manning went on sneeringly. ou could have
been a millionaire. Maybe even a billionaire. ou could have had all the
fine things these other people have. ut you only got twenty thousand.

What can  do? begged Wilson.

The misty face split in a sardonic grin.

 don't believe there's anything left for you to do.

efore Wilson's eyes the face dissolved, lost its lines, seemed to melt
away. nly streaming, swirling mist, then a slight refraction in the air
and then nothing.

Slowly Wilson rose to his feet, reached for the bottle of whiskey on the
table. is hand shook so that the liuor splashed. When he raised the
glass to his mouth, his stillshaking hand poured half the drink over
his white shirt front.

udwig Stutsman pressed his thin, straight lips together. So that's the
setup, he said.

Across the desk Spencer Chambers studied the man. Stutsman was like a
wolf, lean and cruel and vicious. e even looked like a wolf, with his
long, thin face, his small, beady eyes, the thin, bloodless lips. ut he
was the kind of man who didn't always wait for instructions, but went
ahead and used his own udgment. And in a ruthless sort of way, his
udgment was always right.

nly as a last resort, cautioned Chambers, do  want you to use the
etreme measures you are so fond of using. f they should prove
necessary, we can always use them. ut not yet.  want to settle this
thing in the uietest way possible. age and Manning are two men who
can't simply disappear. There'd be a hunt, an investigation, an ugly
situation.

 understand, agreed Stutsman. f something should happen to their
notes, if somebody could find them. erhaps you. f you found them on
your desk one morning.

The two men measured one another with their eyes, more like enemies
than men working for the same ends.

ot my desk, snapped Chambers, Craven's. So that Craven could
discover this new energy. Whatever Craven discovers belongs to
nterplanetary.

Chambers rose from his chair and walked to the window, looked out. After
a moment's time, he turned and walked back again, sat down in his chair.
eaning back, he matched his fingertips, his teeth flashing in a grin
under his mustache.

 don't know anything about what's going on, he said.  don't even
know someone has discovered material energy. That's up to Craven. e has
to find it. oth you and Craven work alone.  know nothing about either
of you.

Stutsman's aw closed like a steel trap. 've always worked alone.

y the way, said Chambers, the edge suddenly off his voice, how are
things going in the ovian confederacy?  trust you left everything in
good shape.

As good as could be epected, Stutsman replied. The people are still
uneasy, half angry. They still remember Mallory.

ut Mallory, obected Chambers, is on a prison ship. n near Mercury
now,  believe.

Stutsman shook his head. They still remember him. We'll have trouble
out there one of these days.

 would hate to have that happen, remarked Chambers softly.  would
regret it very much.  sent you out there to see that nothing happened.

The trouble out there won't be a flash to this thing you were telling
me about, snapped Stutsman.

'm leaving that in your hands, too, Chambers told him.  know you
can take care of it.

Stutsman rose.  can take care of it.

'm sure you can, Chambers said.

e remained standing after Stutsman left, looking at the door through
which the man had gone. Maybe it had been a mistake to call Stutsman in
from Callisto. Maybe it was a mistake to use Stutsman at all. e didn't
like a lot of things the man did ... or the way he did them. rutal
things.

                                   

Slowly Chambers sat down again and his face grew hard.

e had built an empire of many worlds. That couldn't be done with gentle
methods and no sure goal. Fighting every inch from planet to planet, he
had used power to gain power. And now that empire was threatened by two
men who had found a greater power. That threat had to be smashed t
would be smashed

Chambers leaned forward and pressed a buer.

es, Mr. Chambers? said a voice in the communicator.

Send r. Craven in, commanded Chambers.

Craven came in, slouchily, his hair standing on end, his eyes peering
through the thicklensed glasses.

ou sent for me, he growled, taking a chair.

es,  did, said Chambers. ave a drink?

o. And no smoke either.

Chambers took a long cigar from the bo on his desk, clipped off the end
and rolled it in his mouth.

                                   

'm a busy man, Craven reminded him.

uckering lines of amusement wrinkled Chambers' eyes as he lit up,
watching Craven.

ou do seem to be busy, octor, he said.  only wish you had
something concrete to report.

The scientist bristled.  may have in a few days, if you leave me alone
and let me work.

 presume that you are still working on your radiation collector. Any
progress?

ot too much. ou can't epect a man to turn out discoveries to order.
'm working almost night and day now. f the thing can be solved, 'll
solve it.

Chambers glowed. eep up the good work. ut  wanted to talk to you
about something else. ou heard,  suppose, that  lost a barrel of
money on the anthoor echange.

Craven smiled, a sardonic twisting of his lips.  heard something about
it.

 thought you had, said Chambers sourly. f not, you would have been
the only one who hadn't heard how en Wrail took Chambers for a ride.

e really took you then, commented Craven.  thought maybe it was
ust one of those stories.

e took me, but that's not what's worrying me.  want to know how he
did it. o man, not even the most astute student of the market, could
have foretold the trend of the market the way he did. And Wrail isn't
the most astute. t isn't natural when a man who has always played the
safe side suddenly turns the market upside down. Even less natural when
he never makes a mistake.

Well, demanded Craven, what do you want me to do about it? 'm a
scientist. 've never owned a share of stock in my life.

There's an angle to it that might interest you, said Chambers
smoothly, leaning back, puffing at the cigar. Wrail is a close friend
of Manning. And Wrail himself didn't have the money it took to swing
those deals. Somebody furnished that money.

Manning? asked Craven.

What do you think?

f Manning's mied up in it, said Craven acidly, there isn't anything
any of us can do about it. ou're bucking money and genius together.
This Manning is no slouch of a scientist himself and age is better.
They're a combination.

                                   

ou think they're good? asked Chambers.

Good? idn't they discover material energy? The scientist glowered at
his employer. That ought to be answer enough.

es,  know, Chambers agreed irritably. ut can you tell me how they
worked this market deal?

Craven grimaced.  can guess. Those boys didn't stop with ust finding
how to harness material energy. They probably have more things than you
can even suspect. They were working with force fields, you remember,
when they stumbled onto the energy. Force fields are something we don't
know much about. A man monkeying around with them is apt to find almost
anything.

What are you getting at?

My guess would be that they have a new kind of television working in
the fourth dimension, using time as a factor. t would penetrate
anything. othing could stop it. t could go anywhere, at a speed many
times the speed of light ... almost instantaneously.

Chambers sat upright in his chair. Are you sure about this?

Craven shook his head. ust a guess.  tried to figure out what  would
do if  were age and Manning and had the things they had. That's all.

And what would you do?

Craven smiled dourly. 'd be using that television right in this
office, he said. 'd keep you and me under observation all the time.
f what  think is true, Manning is watching us now and has heard every
word we said.

Chambers' face was a harsh mask of anger.  don't believe it could be
done

octor Craven is right, said a uiet voice.

Chambers swung around in his chair and gasped. Greg Manning stood inside
the room, ust in front of the desk.

 hope you don't mind, said Greg. 've been wanting to have a talk
with you.

Craven leaped to his feet, his eyes shining. Three dimensions he
whispered. ow did you do it?

Greg chuckled.  haven't patented the idea, octor. 'd rather not tell
you ust now.

ou will accept my congratulations, however? asked Craven.

That's generous of you.  really hadn't epected this much.

 mean it, said Craven. amned if  don't. Chambers was on his feet,
leaning across the desk, with his hand held out. Greg's right hand came
out slowly.

Sorry,  really can't shake hands, he said. 'm not here, you know.
ust my image.

Chambers' hand dropped to the desk. Stupid of me not to realie that.
ou looked so natural. e sat back in his chair again, brushed his gray
mustache. A smile twisted his lips. So you've been watching me?

ff and on, Greg said.

And what is the occasion of this visit? asked Chambers. ou could
have held a distinct advantage by remaining unseen.  didn't entirely
believe what Craven told me, you know.

That isn't the point at all, declared Greg. Maybe we can get to
understand one another.

So you're ready to talk business.

ot in the sense you mean, Greg said. 'm not willing to make
concessions, but there's no reason why we have to fight one another.

Why, no, said Chambers, there's no reason for that. 'll be willing
to buy your discovery.

 wouldn't sell it to you, Greg told him.

ou wouldn't? Why not? 'm prepared to pay for it.

ou'd pay the price, all right. Anything  asked ... even if it
bankrupted you. Then you'd mark it down to loss, and scrap material
energy. And 'll tell you why.

                                   

A terrible silence hung in the room as the two men eyed one another
across the table.

ou wouldn't use it, Greg went on, because it would remove the
stranglehold you have on the planets. t would make power too cheap. t
would eliminate the necessity of your rented accumulators. The ovian
moons and Mars could stand on their feet without the power you ship to
them. ou could make billions in legitimate profits selling the
apparatus to manufacture the energy ... but you wouldn't want that. ou
want to be dictator of the Solar System. And that is what  intend to
stop.

isten, Manning, said Chambers, you're a reasonable man. et's talk
this thing over without anger. What do you plan to do?

 could put my material engines on the market, said Greg. That would
ruin you. ou wouldn't move an accumulator after that. our
nterplanetary stock wouldn't be worth the paper it is written on.
Material energy would wipe you out.

ou forget  have franchises on those planets, Chambers reminded him.
'd fight you in the courts until hell froe over.

'd prove convenience, economy and necessity. Any court in any land, on
any planet, would rule for me.

Chambers shook his head. ot Martian or ovian courts. 'd tell them to
rule for me and the courts outside of Earth do what  tell them to.

                                   

Greg straightened and backed from the desk.  hate to ruin a man.
ou've worked hard. ou've built a great company.  would be willing, in
return for a handsoff policy on your part, to hold up any announcement
of my material energy until you had time to get out, to save what you
could.

ard fury masked Chambers' face. ou'll never build a material energy
engine outside your laboratory. on't worry about ruining me.  won't
allow you to stand in my way.  hope you understand.

 understand too well. ut even if you are a dictator out on Mars and
enus, even if you do own Mercury and boss the ovian confederacy,
you're ust a man to me. A man who stands for things that  don't like.

Greg stopped and his eyes were like ice crystals.

ou talked to Stutsman today, he said. f  were you,  wouldn't let
Stutsman do anything rash. uss age and  might have to fight back.

Mockery tinged Chambers' voice. Am  to take this as a declaration of
war, Mr. Manning?

Take it any way you like, Greg said.  came here to give you a
proposition, and you tell me you're going to smash me. All  have to say
to you, Chambers, is thiswhen you get ready to smash me, you'd better
have a deep, dark hole all picked out for yourself to hide in. ecause
'll hand you back ust double anything you hand out.

ne of us will have to watch all the time, Greg told uss. We can't
take any chances. Stutsman will try to reach us sooner or later and we
have to be ready for him.

e glanced at the new radar screen they had set up that morning beside
the bank of other controls. Any ship coming within a hundred miles of
the laboratory would be detected instantly and pinpointed.

The board flashed now. n the screen they saw a huge passenger ship
spearing down toward the airport south of them.

With the port that close, said uss, we'll get a lot of signals.

 ordered the elgium factory to rush work on the ship, said Greg.
ut it will be a couple of weeks yet. We ust have to sit tight and
wait. As soon as we have the ship we'll start in on Chambers but until
we get the ship, we ust have to dig in and stay on the defensive.

e studied the scene in the screen. The ship had leveled off, was
banking in to the port. is eyes turned away, took in the laboratory
with its crowding mass of machinery.

We don't want to fool ourselves about Chambers, he said. e may not
have the power here on Earth that he does on the other planets, but he's
got plenty. Feeling the way he does, he'll try to finish us off in a
hurry now.

uss reached out to the table that stood beside the bank of controls and
picked up a small, complicated mechanism. ts face bore nine dials, with
the needles on three of them apparently registering, the other si
motionless.

What is that? asked Greg.

A mechanical detective, said uss. A sort of mechanical shadow. While
you were busy with the stock market stunt,  made several of them. ne
for Wilson and another for Chambers and still another for Craven. e
hoisted and lowered the one in his hand. This one is for Stutsman.

A shadow? asked Greg. o you mean that thing will trail Stutsman?

ot only trail him, said uss. t will find him, wherever he may be.
Some obect every person wears or carries is made of iron or some other
magnetic metal. This 'shadow' contains a tiny bit of that ridiculous
military decoration that Stutsman never allows far away from him. Find
that decoration and you find Stutsman. n another one  have a chunk of
Wilson's belt buckle, that college buckle, you know, that he's so proud
of. Chambers has a ring made of a piece of meteoric iron and that's the
bait for another machine. ave a tiny piece off Craven's spectacles in
his machine. t was easy to get the stuff. The force field enables a man
to reach out and take anything he wants to, from a massive machine to a
microscopic bit of matter. t was a cinch to get the stuff  needed.

uss chuckled and put the machine back on the table. e gestured toward
it.

t maintains a tiny field similar to our television field, he
eplained. ut it's modified along a special derivation with a magnetic
result. t can follow and find the original mass of any metallic
substance it may contain.

Clever, commented Greg.

uss lit his pipe, puffed comfortably. We needed something like that.

The red light on the board snapped on and blinked. uss reached out and
slammed home the lever, twirled dials. t was only another passenger
ship. They relaed, but not too much.

                                   

 wonder what he's up to, said uss.

Stutsman's car had stopped in the dock section of ew ork. Crumbling,
rotting piers and old tumbledown warehouses, deserted and unused since
the last ship sailed the ocean before giving way to air commerce, loomed
darkly, like grim ghosts, in the darkness.

Stutsman had gotten out of the car and said: Wait here.

es, sir, said the voice of the driver.

Stutsman strode away, down a dark street. The televisor kept pace with
him and on the screen he could be seen as a darker shape moving among
the shadows of that old, almost forgotten section of the Solar System's
greatest city.

Another shadow detached itself from the darkness of the street, shuffled
toward Stutsman.

Sir, said a whining voice,  haven't eaten ...

There was a swift movement as Stutsman's stick lashed out, a thud as it
connected with the second shadow's head. The shadow crumpled on the
pavement. Stutsman strode on.

Greg sucked in his breath. e isn't very sociable tonight.

Stutsman ducked into an alley where even deeper darkness lay. uss, with
a delicate adustment, slid the televisor along, closer to Stutsman,
determined not to lose sight of him for an instant.

The man suddenly turned into a doorway so black that nothing could be
seen. Sounds of sharp, impatient rappings came out of the screen as
Stutsman struck the door with his stick.

rilliant illumination sprang out over the doorway, but Stutsman seemed
not to see it, went on knocking. The colors on the screen were
peculiarly distorted.

ltraviolet, grunted Greg. Whoever he's calling on wants to have a
good look before letting anybody in.

The door creaked open and a shaft of normal light spewed out into the
street, turning its murkiness to pallid yellow.

Stutsman stepped inside.

The man at the door erked his head. ack room, he said.

                                   

The televisor slid through the door into the lighted room behind
Stutsman. ust lay thick on the woodwork and floors. atches of plaster
had broken away. Furrows igagged across the floor, marking the path of
heavy boes or furniture which had been pushed along in utter disdain of
the flooring. Cheap wallpaper hung in tatters from the walls, streaked
with water from some broken pipe.

ut the back room was a startling contrast to the first. ich,
comfortable furniture filled it. The floor was covered with a
steelcloth rug and steelcloth hangings, colorfully painted, hid the
walls.

A man sat under a lamp, reading a newspaper. e rose to his feet, like
the sudden uncoiling of springs.

uss gasped. That face was one of the best known faces in the entire
Solar System. A ratlike face, with cruel cunning printed on it that had
been on front pages and T screens often, but never for pay.

Scorio whispered uss.

Greg nodded and his lips were drawn tight.

Stutsman, said Scorio, surprised. ou're the last person in the world
 was epecting. Come in. ave a chair. Make yourself comfortable.

Stutsman snorted. This isn't a social call.

 didn't figure it was, replied the gangster, but sit down anyway.

Gingerly Stutsman sat down on the edge of a chair, hunched forward.
Scorio resumed his seat and waited.

 have a ob for you, Stutsman announced bluntly.

Fine. t isn't often you have one for me. Threefour years ago, wasn't
it?

We may be watched, warned Stutsman.

The mobster started from his chair, his eyes darting about the room.

Stutsman grunted disgustedly. f we're watched, there isn't anything we
can do about it.

We can't, huh? snarled the gangster. Why not?

ecause the watcher is on the West Coast. We can't reach him. f he's
watching, he can see every move we make, hear every word we say.

Who is it?

                                   

Greg Manning or uss age, said Stutsman. ou've heard of them?

Sure.  heard of them.

They have a new kind of television, said Stutsman. They can see and
hear everything that's happening on Earth, perhaps in all the Solar
System. ut  don't think they're watching us now. Craven has a machine
that can detect their televisor. t registers certain field effects they
use. They weren't watching when  left Craven's laboratory ust a few
minutes ago. They may have picked me up since, but  don't think so.

So Craven has made a detector, said Greg calmly. e can tell when
we're watching now.

e's a clever cuss, agreed uss.

Take a look at that machine now, urged Scorio. See if they're
watching. ou shouldn't have come here. ou should have let me know and
 would have met you some place.  can't have people knowing where my
hideout is.

uiet down, snapped Stutsman.  haven't got the machine. t weighs
half a ton.

Scorio sank deeper into his chair, worried. o you want to take a
chance and talk business?

Certainly. That's why 'm here. This is the proposition. Manning and
age are working in a laboratory out on the West Coast, in the
mountains. 'll give you the eact location later. They have some papers
we want. We wouldn't mind if something happened to the laboratory. t
might, for eample blow up. ut we want the papers first.

                                   

Scorio said nothing. is face was uiet and cunning.

Give me the papers, said Stutsman, and 'll see that you get to any
planet you want to. And 'll give you two hundred thousand in
nterplanetary Credit certificates. Give me proof that the laboratory
blew up or melted down or something else happened to it and 'll boost
the figure to five hundred thousand.

Scorio did not move a muscle as he asked: Why don't you have some of
your own mob do this ob?

ecause  can't be connected with it in any way, said Stutsman. f
you slip up and something happens,  won't be able to do a thing for
you. That's why the price is high.

The gangster's eyes slitted. f the papers are worth that much to you,
why wouldn't they be worth as much to me?

They wouldn't be worth a dime to you.

Why not?

ecause you couldn't read them, said Stutsman.

 can read, retorted the gangster.

ot the kind of language on those papers. There aren't more than two
doen people in the Solar System who could read it, perhaps a doen who
could understand it, maybe half a doen who could follow the directions
in the papers. e leaned forward and abbed a forefinger at the
gangster. And there are only two people in the System who could write
it.

What the hell kind of a language is it that only two doen people could
read?

t isn't a language, really. t's mathematics.

h, arithmetic.

o, Stutsman said. Mathematics. ou see? ou don't even know the
difference between the two, so what good would the papers do you?

Scorio nodded. eah, you're right.




CATE EEE


The ariserlin epress thundered through the night, a gigantic ship
that rode high above the Earth. Far below one could see the dim lights
of eastern Europe.

arry Wilson pressed his face against the window, staring down. There
was nothing to see but the tiny lights. They were alone, he and the
other occupants of the ship ... alone in the dark world that surrounded
them.

ut Wilson sensed some other presence in the ship, someone besides the
pilot and his mechanics up ahead, the hostess and the three stodgy
traveling men who were his fellow passengers.

Wilson's hair ruffled at the base of his skull, tingling with an unknown
fear that left him shaken.

A voice whispered in his ear: arry Wilson. So you are running away

ust a tiny voice that seemed hardly a voice at all, it seemed at once
to come from far away and yet from very near. The voice, with an edge of
coldness on it, was one he never would forget.

e cowered in his seat, whimpering.

The voice came again: idn't  tell you that you couldn't run away?
That no matter where you went, 'd find you?

Go away, Wilson whispered huskily. eave me alone. aven't you
hounded me enough?

o, answered the voice, not enough. ot yet. ou sold us out. ou
warned Chambers about our energy and now Chambers is sending men to kill
us. ut they won't succeed, Wilson.

ou can't hurt me, said Wilson defiantly. ou can't do anything but
talk to me. ou're trying to drive me mad, but you can't.  won't let
you. 'm not going to pay any more attention to you.

The whisper chuckled.

ou can't, argued Wilson wildly. All you can do is talk to me. ou've
never done anything but that. ou drove me out of ew ork and out of
ondon and now you're driving me out of aris. ut erlin is as far as 
will go.  won't listen to you any more.

Wilson, whispered the voice, look inside your bag. The bag, Wilson,
where you are carrying that money. That stack of credit certificates.
Almost eleven thousand dollars, what is left of the twenty thousand
Chambers paid you.

With a wild cry Wilson clawed at his bag, snapped it open, pawed through
it.

                                   

The credit certificates were gone

ou took my money, he shrieked. ou took everything  had.  haven't
got a cent. othing ecept a few dollars in my pocket.

ou haven't got that either, Wilson, whispered the voice.

There was a sound of ripping cloth as something like a great, powerful
hand flung aside Wilson's coat, tore away the inside pocket. There was a
brief flash of a wallet and a bundle of papers, which vanished.

The hostess was hurrying toward him.

s there something wrong?

They took ... Wilson began and stopped.

What could he tell her? Could he say that a man half way across the
world had robbed him?

The three traveling men were looking at him.

'm sorry, miss, he stammered.  really am.  fell asleep and
dreamed.

e sat down again, shaken. Shivering, he huddled back into the corner of
his seat. is hands eplored the torn coat pocket. e was stranded, high
in the air, somewhere between aris and erlin ... stranded without
money, without a passport, with nothing but the clothes he wore and the
few personal effects in his bag.

Fighting to calm himself, he tried to reason out his plight. The plane
was entering the Central European Federation and that, definitely, was
no place to be without a passport or without visible means of support. A
thousand possibilities flashed through his mind. They might think he was
a spy. e might be cited for illegal entry. e might be framed by secret
police.

Terror perched on his shoulder and whispered to him. e shivered
violently and drew farther back into the corner of the seat. e clasped
his hands, beat them against his huddled knees.

e would cable friends back in America and have them identify him and
vouch for his character. e would borrow some money from them, ust
enough to get back to America. ut whom would he cable? And with aching
bitterness in his breast, arry Wilson came face to face with the
horrible realiation that nowhere in the world, nowhere in the Solar
System, was there a single person who was his friend. There was no one
to help him.

e bowed his head in his hands and sobbed, his shoulders erking
spasmodically, the sobs racking his body.

The traveling men stared at him unable to understand. The hostess looked
briskly helpless. Wilson knew he looked like a scared fool and he didn't
care.

e was scared.

                                   

Gregory Manning riffled the sheaf of credit certificates, the wallet,
the passport and pile of other papers that lay upon the desk in front of
him.

That closes one little incident, he said grimly. That takes care of
our friend Wilson.

Maybe you were a bit too harsh with him, Greg, suggested ussell age.

Greg shook his head. e was a traitor, the lowest thing alive. e sold
the confidence we placed in him. e traded something that was not his to
trade. e did it for money and now 've taken that money from him.

e shoved the pile of certificates to one side.

ow 've got this stuff, he said,  don't know what to do with it. We
don't want to keep it.

Why not send it to Chambers? suggested uss. e will find the
passport and the money on his desk in the morning. Give him something to
think about tomorrow.




CATE TWEE


Scorio snarled at the four men:  want you to get the thing done right.
 don't want bungling. nderstand?

The bulky, flatfaced man with the scar across his cheek shuffled
uneasily. We went over it a doen times. We know ust what to do.

e grinned at Scorio, but the grin was lopsided, more like a sneering
grimace. At one time the man had failed to sidestep a heat ray and it
had left a neat red line drawn across the right cheek, nipped the end of
the ear.

All right, ete, said Scorio, glaring at the man, your ob is the
heavy work, so ust keep your mind on it. ou've got the two heaters and
the kit.

ete grinned lopsidedly again. eah, my own kit.  can open anything
hollow with this rig.

ou got a real ob tonight, snarled Scorio. Two doors and a safe.
Sure you can do it?

ust leave it to me, ete growled.

Chiy, you're to pilot, Scorio snapped. now the coordinates?

Sure, said Chiy, know them by heart. o it with my eyes shut.

eep your eyes open. We can't have anything go wrong. This is too
important. ou swoop in at top speed and land on the roof. Stand by the
controls and keep a hand on the big heater ust in case of trouble.
ete, Ma and eg will go to the lockdoor. eg will stay there with the
buer and three drums of ammunition.

e whirled on eg. ou got that ammunition?

eg nodded emphatically. Four drums of it, he said. ne solid round
in the gun. Another drum of solid and two eplosive.

There's a thousand rounds in each drum, snapped Scorio, but they last
only a minute, so do your firing in bursts.

 ain't handled buers all these years without knowing something about
them.

There's only two men there, said Scorio, and they'll probably be
asleep. Come down with your motor dead. The lab roof is thick and the
plane landing on those thick tires won't wake them. ut be on your guard
all the time. ete and Ma will go through the lockdoor into the
laboratory and open the safe. ump all the papers and money and whatever
else you find into the bags and then get out fast. op into the plane
and take off. When you're clear of the building, turn the heaters on it.
 want it melted down and the men and stuff inside with it. on't leave
even a button unmelted. Get it?

                                   

Sure, chief, said ete. e dusted his hands together.

ow get going. eat it.

The four men turned and filed out of the room, through the door leading
to the tumbledown warehouse where was hidden the streamlined metal ship.
Swiftly they entered it and the ship nosed gently upward, blasting out
through a broken, frameless skylight, climbing up and up, over the
gleaming spires of ew ork.

ack in the room hung with steelcloth curtains, alone, Scorio lit a
cigarette and chuckled. They won't have a chance, he said.

Who won't? asked a tiny voice from almost in front of him.

Why, Manning and age ... said Scorio, and then stopped. The fire of
the match burned down and scorched his fingers. e dropped it. Who
asked that? he roared.

 did, said the piping voice.

Scorio looked down. A threeinch man sat on a matchbo on the desk

Who are you? the gangster shouted.

'm Manning, said the little man. The one you're going to kill. on't
you remember?

amn you shrieked Scorio. is hand flipped open a drawer and pulled
out a flame pistol. The mule of the pistol came up and blasted.
Screwed down to its smallest diameter, the gun's aim was deadly. A
straight lance of flame, no bigger than a pencil, streamed out, engulfed
the little man, bored into the table top. The bo of matches eploded
with a gush of red that was a dull flash against the blue blae of the
gun.

ut the figure of the man stood within the flame Stood there and
waved an arm at Scorio. The piping voice came out of the heart of the
gun's breath.

Maybe 'd better get a bit smaller. Make me harder to hit. More sport
that way.

                                   

Scorio's finger lifted from the trigger. The flame snapped off.
aboriously climbing out of the still smoking furrow left in the oaken
table top was Greg Manning, not more than an inch tall now.

The gangster laid the gun on the table, stepped closer, warily. With the
palm of a mighty hand he swatted viciously at the little figure.

 got you now

ut the figure seemed to ooe upright between his fingers, calmly
stepped off his hand onto the table. And now it began to grow. Watching
it, Scorio saw it grow to si inches and there it stopped.

What are you? he breathed.

 told you, said the little image. 'm Gregory Manning. The man you
set out to kill. 've watched every move you've made and known
everything you planned.

ut that isn't possible, protested Scorio. ou're out on the West
Coast. This is some trick. 'm ust seeing things.

ou aren't seeing anything imaginary. 'm really here, in this room
with you.  could lift my finger and kill you if  wished ... and maybe
 should.

Scorio stepped back a pace.

ut 'm not going to, said Manning.  have something better saved for
you. Something more appropriate.

ou can't touch me

ook, said Manning sternly. e pointed his finger at a chair. t
suddenly grew cloudy, became a wisp of trailing smoke, was gone.

The gangster backed away, eyes glued to the spot where the chair had
vanished.

ook here, piped the little voice. Scorio erked his head around and
looked.

The chair was in Manning's hand. A tiny chair, but the very one that had
disappeared from the room a moment before.

Watch out warned Manning, and heaved the chair. The tiny chair
seemed to float in the air. Then with a rush it gathered speed, grew
larger. n a split second it was a fullsied chair and it was hurtling
straight at the gangster's head.

With a strangled cry Scorio threw up his arms. The chair crashed into
him, bowled him over.

ow do you believe me? demanded Manning.

Scrambling to his feet, Scorio gibbered madly, for the siinch figure
was growing. e became as large as the average man, and then much
larger. is head cleared the high ceiling by scant inches. is mighty
hands reached out for the gangster.

Scorio scuttled away on hands and knees, yelping with terror.

owerful hands seemed to seie and lift him. The room was blotted out.
The Earth was gone. e was in a place where there was nothing. o light,
no heat, no gravitation. For one searing, blasting second he seemed to
be floating in strangely suspended animation. Then with a olt he became
aware of new surroundings.

e blinked his eyes and looked around. e was in a great laboratory that
hummed faintly with the suggestion of terrific power, that smelled of
oone and seemed filled with gigantic apparatus.

Two men stood in front of him.

e staggered back.

Manning he gasped.

Manning grinned savagely at him. Sit down, Scorio. ou won't have long
to wait. our boys will be along any minute now.

                                   

Chiy crouched over the controls, his eyes on the navigation chart.
nly the thin screech of parted air disturbed the silence of the ship.
The high scream and the slow, precise snacksnack of cards as eg and
Ma played a game of double solitaire with a cold, emotionless
precision.

The plane was near the stratosphere, well off the traveled air lanes. t
was running without lights, but the cabin bulbs were on, carefully
shielded.

ete sat in the copilot's chair beside Chiy. is blank,
epressionless eyes stared straight ahead.

 don't like this ob, he complained.

Why not? asked Chiy.

age and Manning aren't the kind of guys a fellow had ought to be
fooling around with. They ain't ust chumps. ou fool with characters
like them and you got trouble.

Chiy growled at him disgustedly, bent to his controls.

Straight ahead was a thin sliver of a dying Moon that gave barely
enough illumination to make out the great, rugged blocks of the
mountains, like dark, shadowy brushstrokes on a newly started canvas.

ete shuddered. There was something about the thin, watery moonlight,
and those brushstroke hills....

t seems funny up here, he said.

ell, growled Chiy, you're going soft in your old age.

Silence fell between the two. The snacksnack of the cards continued.

ou ain't got nothing to be afraid of, Chiy told ete. This tub is
the safest place in the world. She's overpowered a doen times. She can
outfly anything in the air. She's rayproof and bulletproof and
bombproof. othing can hurt us.

ut ete wasn't listening. That moonlight makes a man see things. Funny
things. ike pictures in the night.

ou're balmy, declared Chiy.

ete started out of his seat. is voice gurgled in his throat. e
pointed with a shaking finger out into the night.

ook he yelled ook

Chiy rose out of his seat ... and froe in sudden terror.

Straight ahead of the ship, etched in silvery moonlines against the
background of the starsprinkled sky, was a grim and terrible face.

t was as big and hard as a mountain.




CATE TTEE


The ship was silent now. Even the whisper of the cards had stopped. eg
and Ma were on their feet, startled by the cries of ete and Chiy.

t's Manning shrieked ete. e's watching us

Chiy's hand whipped out like a striking snake toward the controls and,
as he grasped them, his face went deathly white. For the controls were
locked They resisted all the strength he threw against them and the
ship still bore on toward that mocking face that hung above the Earth.

o something screamed Ma. ou damn fool, do something

 can't, moaned Chiy. The ship is out of control.

t seemed impossible. That ship was fast and tricky and it had reserve
power far beyond any possible need. t handled like a dream ... it was
tops in aircraft. ut there was no doubt that some force more powerful
than the engines and controls of the ship itself had taken over.

Manning's got us suealed ete. We came out to get him and now he
has us instead

The craft was gaining speed. The whining shriek of the air against its
plates grew thinner and higher. istening, one could almost feel and
hear the sucking of the mighty power that pulled it at an ever greater
pace through the tenuous atmosphere.

The face was gone from the sky now. nly the Moon remained, the Moon and
the brushstroke mountains far below.

Then, suddenly, the speed was slowing and the ship glided downward, down
into the sawteeth of the mountains.

We're falling yelled Ma, and Chiy growled at him.

ut they weren't falling. The ship leveled off and floated, suspended
above a sprawling laboratory upon a mountain top.

That's Manning's laboratory, whispered ete in terrorstricken tones.

The levers yielded unepectedly. Chiy flung the power control over,
drove the power of the accumulator bank, all the reserve, into the
engines. The ship lurched, but did not move. The engines whined and
screamed in torture. The cabin's interior was filled with a blast of
heat, the choking odor of smoke and hot rubber. The heavy girders of the
frame creaked under the mighty forward thrust of the engines ... but the
ship stood still, froen above that laboratory in the hills.

Chiy, hauling back the lever, turned around, pale. is hand began
clawing for his heat gun. Then he staggered back. For there were only
two men in the cabin with himeg and Ma. ete had gone

e ust disappeared, Ma abbered. e was standing there in front of
us. Then all at once he seemed to fade, as if he was turning into smoke.
Then he was gone.

                                   

Something had descended about ete. There was no sound, no light, no
heat. e had no sense of weight. t was as if, suddenly, his mind had
become disembodied.

Seeing and hearing and awareness came back to him as one might turn on a
light. From the blackness and the eventless eistence of a split second
before, he was catapulted into a world of light and sound.

t was a world that hummed with power, that was ablae with light, a
laboratory that seemed crammed with mighty banks of massive machinery,
lighted by great globes of creamy brightness, shedding an illumination
white as sunlight, yet shadowless as the light of a cloudy day.

Two men stood in front of him, looking at him, one with a faint smile on
his lips, the other with lines of fear etched across his face. The
smiling one was Gregory Manning and the one who was afraid was Scorio

With a start, ete snatched his pistol from its holster. The sights came
up and lined on Manning as he pressed the trigger. ut the lancing heat
that sprang from the mule of the gun never reached Manning. t seemed
to strike an obstruction less than a foot away. t mushroomed with a
flare of scorching radiance that drove needles of agony into the
gangster's body.

is finger released its pressure and the gun dangled limply from his
hand. e moaned with the pain of burns upon his unprotected face and
hands. e beat feebly at tiny, licking blaes that ran along his
clothing.

Manning was still smiling at him.

ou can't reach me, ete, he said. ou can only hurt yourself. ou're
enclosed within a solid wall of force that matter cannot penetrate.

A voice came from one corner of the room: 'll bring Chiy down net.

ete whirled around and saw ussell age for the first time. The
scientist sat in front of a great control board, his swift, skillful
fingers playing over the banks of keys, his eyes watching the instrument
and the screen that slanted upward from the control banks.

ete felt diy as he stared at the screen. e could see the interior of
the ship he had been yanked from a moment before. e could see his three
companions, talking ecitedly, frightened by his disappearance.

                                   

is eyes flicked away from the screen, looked up through the skylight
above him. utlined against the sky hung the ship. At the nose and
stern, two hemispheres of bluewhite radiance fitted over the metal
framework, like the aws of a powerful vise, holding the craft
immovable.

is gae went back to the screen again, ust in time to see Chiy
disappear. t was as if the man had been a mere figure chalked upon a
board ... and then someone had taken a sponge and wiped him out.

uss's fingers were flying over the keys. is thumb reached out and
tripped a lever. There was a slight hum of power.

And Chiy stood beside him.

Chiy did not pull his gun. e whimpered and cowered within the
invisible cradle of force.

ou're yellow, ete snarled at him, but Chiy only covered his eyes
with his arms.

ook, boss, said ete, addressing Scorio, what are you doing here? We
left you back in ew ork.

Scorio did not answer. e merely glared. ete lapsed into silence,
watching.

                                   

Manning stood poised before the captives, rocking back and forth on his
heels.

A nice bag for one evening, he told uss.

uss grinned and stoked up his pipe.

Manning turned to the gangster chief. What do you think we ought to do
with these fellows? We can't leave them in those force shells too long
because they'll die for lack of air. And we can't let them loose because
they might use their guns on us.

isten, Manning, Scorio rasped hoarsely, ust name your price to let
us loose. We'll do anything you want.

Manning drew his mouth down.  can't think of a thing. We ust don't
seem to have any use for you.

Then what in hell, the gangster asked shakily, are you going to do
with us?

ou know, said Manning,  may be a bit oldfashioned along some
lines. Maybe  am.  ust don't like the idea of killing people for
money.  don't like people stealing things other people have worked hard
to get.  don't like thieves and murderers and thugs corrupting city
governments, taking tribute on every man, woman and child in our big
cities.

ut look here, Manning, pleaded Scorio, we'd be good citiens if we
ust had a chance.

Manning's face hardened. ou sent these men here to kill us tonight,
didn't you?

Well, not eactly. Stutsman kind of wanted you killed, but  told the
boys ust to get the stuff in the safe and never mind killing you. 
said to them that you were pretty good eggs and  didn't like to bump
you off, see?

 see, said Manning.

e turned his back on Scorio and started to walk away. The gangster
chief came halfway out of his chair, and as he did so, uss reached out
a single finger and tapped a key. Scorio screamed and beat with his
fists against the wall of force that had suddenly formed about him. That
single tap on the great keyboard had sprung a trap, had been the one
factor necessary to bring into being a force shell already spun and
waiting for him.

Manning did not even turn around at Scorio's scream. e slowly paced his
way down the line of standing gangsters. e stopped in front of ete and
looked at him.

ete, he said, you've sprung a good many prisons, haven't you?

There ain't a ug in the System that can hold me, ete boasted, and
that's a fact.

 believe there's one that could, Greg told him. ne that no man has
ever escaped from, or ever will.

What's that? demanded ete.

The ulcan Fleet, said Greg.

ete looked into the eyes of the man before him and read the purpose in
those eyes. on't send me there Send me any place but there

Greg turned to uss and nodded. uss's fingers played their tune of doom
upon the keyboard. is thumb depressed a lever. With a roar five
gigantic material energy engines screamed with thrumming power.

ete disappeared.

The engines roared with thunderous throats, a roar that seemed to drown
the laboratory in solid waves of sound. A curious refractive effect
developed about the straining hulks as space near them bent under their
lashing power.

Months ago uss and Greg had learned a better way of transmitting power
than by metal bars or through conducting beams. eams of such power as
were developing now would have smashed atoms to protons and electrons.
Through a window in the side of the near engine, Greg could see the iron
ingot used as fuel dwindling under the sucking force.

                                   

The droning died and only a hum remained.

e's in a prison now he'll never get out of, said Greg calmly. 
wonder what they'll think when they find him, dressed in civilian
clothes and carrying a heat gun. They'll clap him into a photocell and
keep him there until they investigate. When they find out who he is, he
won't get outhe has enough unfinished prison sentences to last a
century or two.

For ete was on one of the ulcan Fleet ships, the hellships of the
prison fleet. There were confined only the most vicious and the most
depraved of the Solar System's criminals. e would be forced to work
under the flaming whiplashes of a Sun that hurled such intense
radiations that mere spacesuits were no protection at all. The workers
on the ulcan Fleet ships wore suits that were in reality photocells
which converted the deadly radiations into electric power. For electric
power can be disposed of where heat cannot.

uailing inside his force shell, Scorio saw his men go, one by one. Saw
them lifted and whisked away, out through the depths of space by the
magic touch upon the keyboards. With terrorwidened eyes he watched
uss set up the euations, saw him trip the activating lever, saw the
men disappear, listened to the thunderous rumbling of the mighty
engines.

Chiy went to the utpost, the harsh prison on eptune's satellite. eg
went to Titan, clear across the Solar System, where men in the infamous
penal colony labored in the frigid wastes of that moon of Saturn. Ma
went to esta, the asteroid prison, which long had been the target of
reformers, who claimed that on it  per cent of the prisoners died of
boredom and fear.

Ma was gone and only Scorio remained.

Stutsman's the one who got us into this, wailed the gangster. e's
the man you want to get. ot me. ot the boys. Stutsman.

 promise you, said Greg, that we'll take care of Stutsman.

And Chambers, too, chattered Scorio. ut you can't touch Chambers.
ou wouldn't dare.

We're not worrying about Chambers, Greg told him. We're not worrying
about anyone. ou're the one who had better start doing some.

Scorio cringed.

et me tell you about a place on enus, said Greg. t's in the center
of a big swamp that stretches for hundreds of miles in every direction.
t's a sort of mountain rising out of the swamp. And the swamp is filled
with beasts and reptiles of every kind. avenous things, lusting for
blood. ut they don't climb the mountain. A man, if he stayed on the
mountain, would be safe. There's food there. oots and berries and
fruits and even small animals one could kill. A man might go hungry for
a while, but soon he'd find the things to eat.

ut he'd be alone. o one ever goes near that mountain.  am the only
man who ever set foot on it. erhaps no one ever will again. At night
you hear the screaming and the crying of the things down in swamp, but
you mustn't pay any attention to them.

                                   

Scorio's eyes widened, staring. ou won't send me there

ou'll find my campfires, Greg told him, if the rain hasn't washed
them away. t rains a lot. So much and so drearily that you'll want to
leave that mountain and walk down into the swamp, of your own free will,
and let the monsters finish you.

Scorio sat dully. e did not move. orror glaed his eyes.

Greg signed to uss. uss, pipe clenched between his teeth, reached out
his fingers for the keys. The engines droned.

Manning walked slowly to a television control, sat down in the chair
and flipped over a lever. A face stared out of the screen. t was
strangely filled with anger and a sort of halffear.

ou watched it, didn't you, Stutsman? Greg asked.

Stutsman nodded.  watched. ou can't get away with it, Manning. ou
can't take the law into your own hands that way.

ou and Chambers have been taking the law into your hands for years,
said Greg. All  did tonight was clear the Earth of some vermin. Every
one of those men was guilty of murder ... and worse.

What did you gain by it? asked Stutsman.

Greg gave a bitter laugh.  convinced you, Stutsman, he said, that it
isn't so easy to kill me.  think it'll be some time before you try
again. etter luck net time.

e flipped the switch and turned about in the chair.

uss erked his thumb at the skylight. Might as well finish the ship
now.

Greg nodded.

An instant later there was a fierce, intolerably bluewhite light that
lit the mountains for many miles. For ust an instant it flared,
eploding into millions of brilliant, harmless sparks that died into
darkness before they touched the ground. The gangster ship was destroyed
beyond all tracing, disintegrated. The metal and uart of which it was
made were simply gone.

uss brought his glance back from the skylight, looked at his friend.
Stutsman will do everything he can to wipe us out. y tomorrow morning
the nterplanetary machine will be rolling. With only one purposeto
crush us.

That's right, Greg agreed, but we're ready for them now. ur ship
left the elgium factories several hours ago. The Comet towed it out
in space and it's waiting for us now. n a few hours the Comet will be
here to pick us up.

War in space, said uss, musingly. That's what it will be.

Chambers and his gang won't fight according to any rules. There'll be
no holds barred, no more feeble attempts like the one they tried
tonight. From now on we need a base that simply can't be located.

The ship, said uss.




CATE FTEE


The nvincible hung in space, an empty, airless hull, the largest
thing afloat.

Chartered freighters, leaving their ports from distant parts of the
Earth, had converged upon her hours before, had unloaded crated
apparatus, storing it in the yawning hull. Then they had departed.

ow the sturdy little spaceyacht, Comet, was towing the great ship
out into space, , miles beyond the orbit of the Moon. Slowly the
hull was being taken farther and farther away from possible discovery.

Work on the installation of the apparatus had started almost as soon as
the Comet had first tugged at the ponderous mass. eaving only a
skeleton crew in charge of the Comet, the rest of the selected crew
had begun the assembly of the mighty machines which would transform the
nvincible into a thing of unimaginable power and speed.

The doors were closed and sealed and the air, already stored in the
ship's tanks, was released. The slight acceleration of the Comet's
towing served to create artificial weight for easier work, but not
enough to handicap the shifting of the heavier pieces of apparatus. An
electric cable was run back from the little yacht and the nvincible
took her first breath of life.

The work advanced rapidly, for every man was more than a mere engineer
or spacebuster. They were a selected crew, the men who had helped to
make the name of Gregory Manning famous throughout the Solar System.

First the engines were installed, then the two groups of five massive
power plants and the single smaller engine as an auiliary supply plant
for the light, heat, air.

The accumulators of the Comet were drained in a single tremendous
surge and the auiliary generator started. t in turn awoke to life the
other power plants, to leave them sleeping, idling, but ready for
instant use to develop power such as man never before had dreamed of
holding and molding to his will.

Then, with the gigantic tools these engines supplied ... tools of pure
force and strange space fields ... the work was rapidly completed. The
power boards were set in place, welded in position by a sudden furious
blast of white hot metal and as eually sudden freeing, to be followed
by careful heating and recooling till the berylsteel reached its
maimum strength. ver the hull swarmed spacesuited men, using that
strange new power, heattreating the stubborn metal in a manner never
before possible.

The generators were charging the atoms of the ship's berylsteel hide
with the same hay force that had trapped and held the gangster ship in
a mighty vise. Thus charged, no material thing could penetrate them. The
greatest meteor would be crushed to drifting dust without so much as
scarring that wall of mighty force ... meteors traveling with a speed
and penetrative power that no gunhurled proectile could ever hope to
attain.

iding under her own power, driven by the concentration of gravitational
lines, impregnable to all known forces, containing within her hull the
secrets of many strange devices, the nvincible wheeled in space.

                                   

ussell age lounged in a chair before the control manual of the
teletransport machine. e puffed placidly at his pipe and looked out
through the great sweep of the vision panel. ut there was the black of
space and the glint of stars, the soft glow of distant upiter.

Greg Manning was hunched over the navigation controls, sharp eyes
watching the panorama of space.

uss looked at him and grinned. n Greg's face there was a smile, but
about his eyes were lines of alert watchfulness and thought. Greg
Manning was in his proper role at the controls of a ship such as the
nvincible, a man who never stepped backward from danger, whose spirit
hungered for the vast stretches of void that lay between the worlds.

uss leaned back, blowing smoke toward the higharched control room
ceiling.

They had burned their bridges behind them. The laboratory back in the
mountains was destroyed. ocked against any possible attack by a sphere
of force until the teletransport had lifted from it certain items of
euipment, it had been melted into a mass of molten metal that formed a
pool upon the mountain top, that ran in gushing, fiery ribbons down the
mountain side, flowing in gleaming curtains over precipices. t would
have been easier to have merely disintegrated in one bursting flash of
energy, but that would have torn apart the entire mountain range,
overwhelmed and toppled cities hundreds of miles away, dealt Earth a
staggering blow.

A skeleton crew had taken the Comet back to Earth and landed it on
Greg's estate. nce again the teletransport had reached out, wrapped
its fingers around the men who stepped from the little ship. n less
than the flash of a strobe light, they had been snatched back to the
nvincible, through a million miles of space, through the very walls
of the ship itself. ne second they had been on Earth, the net second
they were in the control room of the nvincible, grinning, saluting
Greg Manning, trotting back to their uarters in the engine rooms.

                                   

uss stared out at space, puffed at his pipe, considering.

A thousand years ago men had held what they called tournaments. Armored
knights rode out into the ousting grounds and broke their lances to
prove which was the better man. Today there was to be another
tournament. This ship was to be their charger, and the gauntlet had been
flung to Spencer Chambers and nterplanetary ower. And all of space was
to be the ousting grounds.

This was war. War without trappings, without fanfare, but bitter war
upon which depended the future of the Solar System. A war to break the
grip of steel that nterplanetary accumulators had gained upon the
planets, to shatter the grim dream of empire held by one man, a war for
the right to give to the people of the worlds a source of power that
would forever unshackle them.

ack in those days, a thousand years ago, men had built a system of
government that historians called the feudal system. y this system
certain men were called lords or barons and other titles. They held the
power of life and death over the men under them.

This was what Spencer Chambers was trying to do with the Solar
System ... what he would do if someone did not stop him.

                                   

uss bit viciously on his pipestem.

The Earth, the Solar System, never could revert to that ancient way of
government. The proud people spawned on the Earth, swarming outward to
the other planets, must never have to bow their heads as minions to an
overlord.

The thrum of power was beating in his brain, the droning, humming power
from the engine rooms that would blast, once and forever, the last
threat of dictatorship upon any world. The power that would free a
people, that would help them on and up and outward to the great destiny
that was theirs.

And this had come because, wondering, groping, curiously, he had sought
to heat a slender thread of imperm wire within Force Field , because
another man had listened and had made available his fortune to continue
the eperiments. lind luck and human curiosity ... perhaps even the
madness of a human dream ... and from those things had come this great
ship, this mighty power, these many bulking pieces of euipment that
would perform wonders never guessed at less than a year ago.

Greg Manning swiveled his chair. Well, uss, we're ready to begin.
et's get Wrail first.

uss nodded silently, his mind still half full of fleeting thought.
Absentmindedly he knocked out his pipe and pocketed it, swung around to
the manual of the televisor. is fingers reached out and tapped a
pattern.

Callisto appeared within the screen, leaped upward at them. Then the
surface of the froen little world seemed to rotate swiftly and a dome
appeared.

The televisor dived through the dome, sped through the city, straight
for a penthouse apartment.

en Wrail sat slumped in a chair. A newspaper was crumpled at his feet.
n his lap lay a mangled dead cigar.

Greg yelled uss. Greg, there's something wrong

Greg leaped forward, stared at the screen. uss heard his smothered cry
of rage.

n Wrail's forehead was a tiny, neatly drilled hole from which a single
drop of blood ooed.

Murdered eclaimed uss.

es, murdered, said Greg, and there was a sudden calmness in his
voice.

uss grasped the televisor control. anthoor's streets ran beneath them,
curiously silent and deserted. ere and there lay bodies. A few shop
windows were smashed. ut the only living that stirred was a dog that
slunk across the street and into the shadows of an alley.

Swiftly the televisor swung along the streets. Straight into the screen
clanked a marching detail of government police, herding before them a
half doen prisoners. The men had their hands bound behind their backs,
but they walked with heads held high.

evolution, gasped uss.

ot a revolution. A purge. Stutsman is clearing the city of all who
might be dangerous to him. This will be happening on every other planet
where Chambers holds control.

erspiration ran down uss's forehead and dripped into his eyes as he
manipulated the controls.

Stutsman is striking first, said Greg, calmly ... far too calmly.
e's consolidating his position, possibly on the pretense that plots
have been discovered.

A few buildings were bombed. A line of bodies were crumpled at the foot
of a steel wall, marking the spot where men had been lined up and mowed
down with one sweeping blast from a heater.

uss turned the television controls. et's see about enus and Mars.

The scenes in anthoor were duplicated in Sandebar on Mars, in ew
Chicago, the capital of enus. Everywhere Stutsman had struck ...
everywhere the purge was wiping out in blood every person who might
revolt against the Chambersdictated governments. Throughout the Solar
System violence was on the march, ironshod boots trampling the rights
of free men to tighten the grip of nterplanetary.

                                   

n the control room of the nvincible the two men stared at one
another.

There's one man we need, said Greg. ne man, if he's still alive, and
 think he is.

Who is that? asked uss.

ohn Moore Mallory, said Greg.

Where is he?

 don't know. e was imprisoned in anthoor, but Stutsman transferred
him some place else. ossibly to one of the prison fleet.

f we had the records of the Callisto prison, suggested uss, we
could find out.

f we had the records ...

We'll get them uss said.

e swung back to the keyboard again.

A moment later the administration offices of the prison were on the
screen.

The two men searched the vision plate.

The records are most likely in that vault, said uss. And the vault
is locked.

on't worry about the lock, snapped Greg. ust bring the whole damn
thing herevault and records and all.

uss nodded grimly. is thumb tripped the teletransport control and
from the engine rooms came a drone of power. n anthoor rison, great
bands of force wrapped themselves around the vault, clutching it,
enfolding it within a sphere of power. ack in the nvincible the
engines screamed and the vault was ripped out of the solid steel wall as
easily as a man might rip a button from his shirt.




CATE FFTEE


ohn Moore Mallory sat on the single metal chair within his cell and
pressed his face against the tiny vision port. For hours he had sat
there, staring out into the blackness of space.

There was bitterness in ohn Moore Mallory's soul, a terrible and futile
bitterness. So long as he had remained within the anthoor prison, there
had always been a chance of escape. ut now, aboard the penal ship,
there was no hope. othing but the taunting reaches of space, the
mocking pinpoints of the stars, the hooting laughter of the engines.

Sometimes he had thought he would go mad. The everlasting routine, the
meaningless march of hours. The work period, the sleep period ... the
work period, the sleep period ... endless monotony, an eistence without
a purpose. Men buried alive in space.

ohn Moore Mallory, said a voice.

Mallory heard, but he did not stir. An awful thought crossed his mind.
ow he was hearing voices calling his name

ohn Mallory, said the voice again.

Mallory slowly turned about and as he turned he started from his chair.

A man stood in the cell A man he had never seen before, who had come
silently, for there had been no screech of opening door.

ou are ohn Moore Mallory, aren't you? asked the man.

es,  am Mallory. Who are you?

Gregory Manning.

Gregory Manning, said Mallory wonderingly. 've heard of you. ou're
the man who rescued the luto Epedition. ut why are you here? ow did
you get in?

 came to take you away with me, said Greg. ack to Callisto. ack to
any place you want to go.

Mallory flattened himself against the partition, his face white with
disbelief. ut 'm in a prison ship. 'm not free to go and come as 
please.

Greg chuckled. ou are free to go and come as you please from now on,
he said. Even prison ships can't hold you.

ou're mad, whispered Mallory. Either you're mad or  am. ou're a
dream. 'll wake up and find you gone.

Manning stood in silence, looking at the man. Mallory bore the marks of
prison on him. is eyes were haunted and his rugged face was pinched and
thin.

isten closely, Mallory, said Greg softly. ou aren't going mad and
'm not mad. ou aren't seeing things. ou aren't hearing things. ou're
actually talking to me.

                                   

There was no change in the other's face.

Mallory, Greg went on,  have what you've always neededmeans of
generating almost unlimited energy at almost no cost, the secret of the
energy of matter. A secret that will smash nterplanetary, that will
free the Solar System from Spencer Chambers. ut  can't make that
secret available to the people until Chambers is crushed, until 'm sure
that he can't take it from me. And to do that  need your help.

Mallory's face lost its epression of bewilderment, suddenly lighted
with realiation. ut his voice was harsh and bitter.

ou came too late.  can't help you. emember, 'm in a prison ship
from which no one can escape. ou have to do what you can ... you must
do what you can. ut  can't be with you.

Manning strode forward. ou don't get the idea at all.  said 'd get
you out of here and 'm going to.  could pick up this ship and put it
wherever  wanted. ut  don't want to.  ust want you.

Mallory stared at him.

ust don't be startled, said Greg. Something will happen soon. Get
ready for it.

Feet drummed on the metal corridor outside.

ey, you, pipe down yelled the voice of the guard. ou know there's
no talking allowed now. Go to sleep.

That's the guard, Mallory whispered fiercely. They'll stop us.

Greg grinned viciously. o, they won't.

                                   

The guard came into view through the grilled door.

So it's you, Mallory ... he began, stopping in amaement. ey, you
he shouted at Greg. Who are you? ow did you get in that cell?

Greg flipped a hand in greeting. leasant evening, isn't it?

The guard grabbed for the door, but he did not reach the bars. Some
force stopped him si inches away. t could not be seen, could not be
felt, but his straining against it accomplished nothing.

Mallory and  are leaving, Greg told the guard. We don't like it
here. Too stuffy.

The guard lifted a whistle and blew a blast. Feet pounded outside. A
prisoner yelled from one of the cells. Another catcalled. nstantly the
ship was in an uproar. The convicts took up the yammering, shaking the
bars on their doors.

et's get started, Greg said to Mallory. old tight.

lackness engulfed Mallory. e felt a peculiar twisting wrench. And then
he was standing in the control room of a ship and Gregory Manning and
another man were smiling at him. White light poured down from a cluster
of globes. Somewhere in the ship engines purred with the hum of power.
The air was fresh and pure, making him realie how foul and stale the
air of the prison ship had been.

Greg held out his hand. Welcome to our ship.

Mallory gripped his hand, blinking in the light. Where am ?

ou are on the nvincible, five million miles off Callisto.

ut were you here all the time? asked Mallory. Were you in my cell
back there or weren't you?

 was really in your cell, Greg assured him.  could have ust thrown
my image there, but  went there personally to get you. uss age, here,
sent me out. When  gave him the signal, he brought both of us back.

'm glad you're with us, uss said. erhaps you'd like a cup of
coffee, something to eat.

Mallory stammered. Why,  really would. e laughed. ations weren't
too good in the prison ship.

They sat down while uss rang the galley for coffee and sandwiches.

Crisply, Greg informed Mallory of the situation.

We want to start manufacturing these engines as soon as possible, he
eplained, but  haven't even dared to patent them. Chambers would
simply buy out the officials if  tried it on Earth, delay the patent
for a few days and then send through papers copied from ours. ou know
what he'd do with it if he got the patent rights. e'd scrap it and the
old accumulator business would go on as always. f  tried it on any
other world, with any other government, he'd see that laws were passed
to block us. e'd probably instruct the courts to rule against the
manufacture of the engines on the grounds that they were dangerous.

Mallory's face was grave. There's only one answer, he said. With the
situation on the worlds, with this purge you told me about, there's only
one thing to do. We have to act at once. Every minute we wait gives
Stutsman ust that much longer to tighten his hold.

And that answer? asked uss.

evolution, said Mallory. Simultaneous revolution in the ovian
confederacy, on Mars and enus. nce free, the planets will stay free
with your material energy engines. Spencer Chambers and his idea of
Solar System domination will be too late.

                                   

Greg's forehead was wrinkled in thought, his facial muscles tensed.

First thing to do, he said, is to contact all the men we can find ...
men we can rely on to help us carry out our plans. We'll need more
televisor machines, more teleport machines, some for use on Mars and
enus, others for the ovian moons. We will have to bring the men here
to learn to operate them. t'll take a few days. We'll get some men to
work on new machines right away.

e started to rise from his chair, but at that moment the coffee and
sandwiches arrived.

Greg grinned. We may as well eat first.

Mallory looked grateful and tried to keep from wolfing the food. The
others pretended not to notice.

                                   

Grim hours followed, an unrelenting search over two planets and four
moons for men whom Mallory considered loyal to his causemen willing to
risk their lives to throw off the yoke of nterplanetary.

They were hard to find. Many of them were dead, victims of the purge.
The others were in hiding and word of them was difficult to get.

ut slowly, one by one, they were ferreted out, the plan eplained to
them, and then, by means of the teletransport, they were brought to the
nvincible.

our after hour men worked, stripped to their waists, in the glaring
inferno of terrible force fields, fashioning new television units. As
fast as the sets were constructed, they were placed in operation.

The work went faster than could be epected, yet it was maddeningly
slow.

For with the passing of each hour, Stutsman clamped tighter his iron
grip on the planets. Concentration camps were filled to overflowing.
uildings were bombed and burned. Murders and eecutions were becoming
too common to be news.

Then suddenly there was a new development.

Greg, Craven has found something uss cried.  can't get him

Supervising the installation of a new televisor set, Greg spun around.
What's that?

Craven  can't reach him. e's blocking me out

Greg helped, but the apparatus was unable to enter the nterplanetary
building in ew ork. Certain other portions of the city adacent to the
building also were blanketed out. n all the Solar System, the
nterplanetary building was the only place they could not enter, ecept
the Sun itself.

Craven had developed a field from which their field shied off. The
televisor seemed to roll off it like a drop of mercury. That definitely
ended all spying on Craven and Chambers.

uss mopped his brow, sucked at his dead pipe.

ight penetrates it, he said. Matter penetrates it, electricity, all
ordinary forces. ut this field won't. t's ... well, whatever Craven
has is similarly dissimilar. The same thing of opposite nature. t
repels our field, but doesn't affect anything else. That means he has
analyed our fields. We have Wilson to thank for this.

Greg nodded gravely. There's ust one thing to be thankful for, he
declared. e probably isn't any nearer our energy than he was before.
ut now we can't watch him. And that field of his shows that he has
tremendous power of some sort.

We can't watch him, but we can follow him, corrected uss. e can't
shake us. one of them can. The mechanical shadow will take care of
that.  have one for Craven with a bit of 'bait' off his spectacles and
he'll keep those spectacles, never fear. e's blind as a bat without
them. And we can track Chambers with his ring.

That's right, agreed Greg, but we've got to speed up. Craven is
getting under way now. f he does this, he can do something else.
Something that will really hurt us. The man's clever ... too damn
clever.




CATE STEE


A miracle came to pass in anthoor when a man for whom all hope had been
abandoned suddenly appeared within the city's streets. ut he appeared
to be something not uite earthly, for he did not have the solidity of a
man. e was pale, like a wraith from out of space, and one could see
straight through him, yet he still had all the old mannerisms and
tricks.

n frightened, awestricken whispers the word was spread ... the spirit
of ohn Moore Mallory had come back to the city once again. e bulked
four times the height of a normal man and there was that singular
ghostliness about him. From where he had come, or how, or why, no one
seemed to know.

ut when he reached the steps of the federation's administration
building and walked straight through a line of troopers that suddenly
massed to bar his way, and when he turned on those steps and spoke to
the people who had gathered, there was none to doubt that at last a sign
had come. The sign that now, if ever, was the time to avenge the purge.
ow the time to take vengeance for the blood that flowed in gutters, for
the throaty chortling of the flame guns that had snuffed out lives
against a broad steel wall.

Standing on the steps, shadowy but plainly visible, ohn Moore Mallory
talked to the people in the suare below, and his voice was the voice
they remembered. They saw him toss his black mane of hair, they saw his
clenched fist raised in terrible anger, they heard the boom of the words
he spoke.

ike a shrilling alarm the words spread through the city, reverberating
from the dome, seeking out those who were in hiding. From every corner
of the city, from its deepest cellars and its darkest alleys, poured out
a mass of humanity that surrounded the capitol and blackened the suare
and the converging streets with a mob that shrieked its hatred, bellowed
its anger.

ower thundered the mighty shadow on the steps. ower to burn ower
to give away. ower to heat the dome, to work your mines, to drive your
spaceships

ower answered the voice of the crowd. ower t sounded like a
battle cry.

o more accumulators, roared the towering image. ever again need you
rely on Spencer Chambers for your power. Callisto is yours. anthoor is
yours.

The black crowd surged forward, reached the steps and started to climb,
wild cheers in their throat, the madness of victory in their eyes. p
the steps came men with nothing but bare hands, screaming women, eering
children.

fficers snapped orders at the troops that lined the steps, but the
troopers, staring into the awful, raging maw of that oncoming crowd,
dropped their guns and fled, back into the capitol building, with the
mob behind them, shrilling blood lust and longawaited vengeance.

                                   

ut of the red and yellow wilderness of the deserts, a man came to
Sandebar on Mars. e had long been thought dead. The minions of the
government had announced that he was dead. ut he had been in hiding for
si years.

is beard was long and gray, his eyes were curtained by hardship, his
white hair hung about his shoulders and he was clothed in the tattered
leather trappings of the spaceways.

ut men remembered him.

Tom rown had lead the last revolt against the Martian government, an
illstarred revolt that ended almost before it started when the
troopers turned loose the heavy heaters and swept the streets with
washing waves of flame.

When he climbed to the base of a statue in Techor ark to address the
crowd that gathered, the police shouted for him to come down and he
disregarded them. They climbed the statue to reach him and their hands
went through him.

Tom rown stood before the people, in plain view, and spoke, but he
wasn't there

ther things happened in Sandebar that day. A voice spoke out of thin
air, a voice that told the people the reign of nterplanetary was over.
t told of a mighty new source of power. ower that would cost almost
nothing. ower that would make the accumulators unnecessary ... would
make them out of date. A voice that said the people need no longer
submit to the yoke of Spencer Chambers' government in order to obtain
the power they needed.

There was no one there ... no one visible at all. And yet that voice
went on and on. A great crowd gathered, listening, cheering. The police
tried to break it up and failed. The troops were ordered out and the
people fought them until the voice told them to disband peaceably and go
to their homes.

Throughout Mars it was the same.

n a doen places in Sandebar the voice spoke. t spoke in a doen
places, out of empty air, in Malacon and Aleon and Adebron.

Tom rown, vanishing into the air after his speech was done, reappeared
a few minutes later in Adebron and there the police, warned of what had
happened in Sandebar, opened fire upon him when he stood on a park bench
to address the people. ut the flames passed through and did not touch
him. Tom rown, his long white beard covering his chest, his mad eyes
flashing, stood in the fiery blast that bellowed from the mules of the
flame rifles and calmly talked.

                                   

The chief of police at ew Chicago, enus, called the police
commissioner. There's a guy out here in the park, ust across the
street. e's preaching treason. e's telling the people to overthrow the
government.

n the ground glass the police commissioner's face grew purple.

Arrest him, he ordered the chief. Clap him in the ug. o you have to
call me up every time one of those fieryeyed boys climbs a soap bo?
un him in.

 can't, said the chief.

The police commissioner seemed ready to eplode. ou can't? Why the
hell not?

Well, you know that hill in the center of the park? Memorial ill?

What has a hill got to do with it? the commissioner roared.

e's sitting on top of that hill. e's a thousand feet tall. is head
is way up in the sky and his voice is like thunder. ow can you arrest
anybody like that?

                                   

Everywhere in the System, revolt was flaming. ew marching songs rolled
out between the worlds, wild marching songs that had the note of anger
in them. Weapons were brought out of hiding and polished. ew standards
were raised in an everrising tide against oppression.

Freedom was on the march again. The right of a man to rule himself the
way he chose to rule. A new declaration of independence. A Solar Magna
Carta.

There were new leaders, led by the old leaders. ed by spirits that
marched across the sky. ed by voices that spoke out of the air. ed by
signs and symbols and a newborn courage and a great and a deep
conviction that right in the end would triumph.

                                   

Spencer Chambers glared at udwig Stutsman. This is one time you went
too far.

f you'd given me a free hand before, this wouldn't have been
necessary, Stutsman said. ut you were soft. ou made me go easy when
 should have ground them down. ou left the way open for all sorts of
plots and schemes and leaders to develop.

The two men faced one another, one the smooth, tawny lion, the other the
snarling wolf.

ou've built up hatred, Stutsman, Chambers said. ou are the most
hated man in the Solar System. And because of you, they hate me. That
wasn't my idea.  needed you because  needed an iron fist, but  needed
it to use udiciously. And you have been ruthless. ou've used force
when conciliation was necessary.

Stutsman sneered openly. Still that old dream of a benevolent
dictatorship. Still figuring yourself a little brone god to be set up
in every household. A dictatorship can't be run that way. ou have to
let them know you're boss.

Chambers was calm again. Argument won't do us any good now. The damage
is done. evolt is flaming through all the worlds. We have to do
something.

e looked at Craven, who was slouched in a chair beside the desk across
which he and Stutsman faced each other.

Can you help us, doctor? he asked.

Craven shrugged. erhaps, he said acidly. f  could only be left to
my work undisturbed, instead of being dragged into these stupid
conferences,  might be able to do something.

ou already have, haven't you? asked Chambers.

ery little. 've been able to blank out the televisor that Manning and
age are using, but that is all.

o you have any idea where Manning and age are?

ow could  know? Craven asked. Somewhere in space.

They're at the bottom of this, snarled Stutsman. Their damned tricks
and propaganda.

We know they're at the bottom of it, said Craven. That's no news to
us. f it weren't for them, we wouldn't have this trouble now, despite
your bungling. ut that doesn't help us any. With this new discovery of
mine  have shielded this building from their observation. They can't
spy on us any more. ut that's as far as 've got.

They televised the secret meeting of the emergency council when it met
in Satellite City on Ganymede the other day, said Chambers. The whole
ovian confederacy watched and listened to that meeting, heard our
secret war plans, for fully ten minutes before the trick was discovered.
Couldn't we use your shield to prevent such a situation again?

etter still, suggested Stutsman, let's shield the whole satellite.
Without Manning's ghostly leaders, this revolt would collapse of its own
weight.

Craven shook his head. t takes fifty tons of accumulators to build up
that field, and a ton of fuel a day to maintain it. ust for this
building alone. t would be impossible to shield a whole planet, an
entire moon.

                                   

Any progress on your collector field? asked Chambers.

Some, Craven admitted. 'll know in a day or two.

That would give us something with which to fight Manning and age,
wouldn't it?

es, agreed Craven. t would be something to fight them with. f 
can develop that collector field, we would be able to utilie every
radiation in space, from the heat wave down through the cosmics. Within
the Solar System, our power would be absolutely limitless. our
accumulators depend for their power storage upon ust one radiation ...
heat. ut with this idea  have you'd use all types of radiations.

ou say you could even put the cosmics to work? asked Chambers.

Craven nodded. f  can do anything at all with the field,  can.

ow? demanded Stutsman.

y breaking them up, you fool. Smash the short, highpowered waves into
a lot of longer, lowerpowered waves. Craven swung back to face
Chambers. ut don't count on it, he warned.  haven't done it yet.

ou have to do it, Chambers insisted.

Craven rose from his chair, his blue eyes blaing angrily behind the
heavy lenses. ow often must  tell you that you cannot hurry
scientific investigation? ou have to try and try ... follow one tiny
clue to another tiny clue. ou have to be patient. ou have to hope. ut
you cannot force the work.

e strode from the room, slammed the door behind him.

Chambers turned slowly in his chair to face Stutsman. is gray eyes
bored into the wolfish face.

And now, he suggested, suppose you tell me ust why you did it.

Stutsman's lips curled.  suppose you would rather  had allowed those
troublemakers to go ahead, consolidate their plans. There was only one
thing to doroot them out, liuidate them.  did it.

ou chose a poor time, said Chambers softly. ou would have to do
something like this, ust at the time when Manning is lurking around the
Solar System somewhere, carrying enough power to wipe us off the face of
the Earth if he wanted to.

That's why  did it, protested Stutsman.  knew Manning was around. 
was afraid he'd start something, so  beat him to it.  thought it would
throw a scare into the people, make them afraid to follow Manning when
he acted.

                                   

ou have a low opinion of the human race, don't you? Chambers said.
ou think you can beat them into a mire of helplessness and fear.

Chambers rose from his chair, pounded his desk for emphasis.

ut you can't do it, Stutsman. Men have tried it before you, from the
very dawn of history. ou can destroy their homes and kill their
children. ou can burn them at the stake or in the electric chair, hang
them or spacewalk them or herd them into gas chambers. ou can drive
them like cattle into concentration camps, you can keep the torture
racks bloody, but you can't break them.

ecause the people always survive. Their courage is greater than the
courage of any one man or group of men. They always reach the man who
has oppressed them, they always tear him down from the place he sits,
and they do not deal gently with him when they do. n the end the
people always win.

Chambers reached across the desk and caught Stutsman by the slack of the
shirt. A twist of his hand tightened the fabric around Stutsman's neck.
The financier thrust his face close to the wolfish scowl. That is what
is going to happen to you and me. We'll go down in history as ust a
couple of damn fools who tried to rule and couldn't make the grade.
Thanks to you and your damned stupidity. ou and your blood purges

atches of anger burned on Stutsman's cheeks. is eyes glittered and his
lips were white. ut his whisper was bitter mockery. Maybe we should
have coddled and humored them. Made them ust so awful happy that big
bad old nterplanetary had them. So they could have set up little brone
images of you in their homes. So you could have been sort of a solar
god

 still think it would have been the better way. Chambers flung
Stutsman from him with a straightarmed push. The man reeled and
staggered across the carpeted floor. Get out of my sight

Stutsman straightened his shirt, turned and left.

Chambers slumped into his chair, his hands grasping the arms on either
side of his great body, his eyes staring out through the window from
which flooded the last rays of the afternoon Sun.

                                   

rums pounded in his brain ... the drums of rebellion out in space, of
rebellion on those other worlds ... drums that were drowning out and
shattering forever the dream that he had woven. e had wanted economic
dictatorship ... not the cold, passionless, terrible dictatorship that
Stutsman typified ... but one that would bring peace and prosperity and
happiness to the Solar System.

e closed his eyes and thought. Snatches of ambition, snatches of
hopes ... but it was useless to think, for the drums and the imagined
shouting drowned out his thoughts.

Mankind didn't give a damn for good business administration, nor a hoot
for prosperity or peace or happiness. iberty and the right to rule, the
right to go risk one's neck ... to climb a mountain or cross a desert or
eplore a swamp, the right to aim one's sights at distant stars, to
fling a taunting challenge into the teeth of space, to probe with clumsy
fingers and force nature to lay bare her secrets ... that was what
mankind wanted. That was what those men out on Mars and enus and in
the ovian worlds were fighting for. ot against Spencer Chambers or
udwig Stutsman or nterplanetary ower, but for the thing that drove
man on and made of him a flame that others might follow. Fighting for a
heritage that was first epressed when the first man growled at the
entrance to his cave and dared the world to take it from him.

Spencer Chambers closed his eyes and rocked back and forth in the
tilting office chair.

t had been a good fight, a hard fight. e had had a lot of fun out of
it. ut he was licked, after all these years. e had held the biggest
dream of any man who ever lived. Aleander and apoleon, itler, Stalin
and those other fellows had been pikers alongside of Spencer Chambers.
They had only aimed at Earthly conuest while he had reached out to grab
at all the worlds. ut by heaven, he'd almost made it

A door grated open.

Chambers said a voice.

is feet hit the floor with a thud and he sat stiff and staring at the
figure in the door.

t was Craven and the man was ecited. is glasses were slid far down on
his nose, his hair was standing on end, his tie was all awry.

 have it Craven whooped.  have it at last

ope clutched at Chambers, but he was almost afraid to speak.

ave what? he whispered tensely.

The collector field t was under my nose all the time, but  didn't
see it

Chambers was out of his chair and striding across the room. A tumult
bued within his skull.

icked? ell, he hadn't even started e'd win yet. e'd teach the
people to revolt e'd run Manning and age out to the end of space and
push them through




CATE SEETEE


t was a weird revolution. There were few battles, little blood shed.
There seemed to be no secret plots. There were no skulking leaders, no
passwords, nothing that in former years had marked rebellion against
tyranny.

t was a revolution carried out with utter boldness. Secret police were
helpless, for it was not a secret revolution. The regular police and the
troopers were helpless because the men they wanted to arrest were
shadows that flitter here and there ... large and substantial shadows,
but impossible to seie and imprison.

Every scheme that was hatched within the government circles was known
almost at once to the ghostly leaders who stalked the land. olice
detachments, armed with warrants for the arrests of men who had
participated in some action which would stamp them as active rebels,
found the suspects absent when they broke down the doors. Someone had
warned them. Troops, hurried to points where riots had broken out,
arrived to find peaceful scenes, but with evidence of recent battle. The
rioters had been warned, had made their getaway.

When the rebels struck it was always at the most opportune time, when
the government was off balance or off guard.

n the first day of the revolt, anthoor fell when the maddened
populace, urged on by the words of a shadowy ohn Moore Mallory, charged
the federation buildings. The government fled, leaving all records
behind, to Satellite City on Ganymede.

n the first week three Martian cities fell, but Sandebar, the capital,
still held out. n enus, adium City was taken by the rebels within
twentyfour hours after the first call to revolt had rung across the
worlds, but ew Chicago, the seat of government, still was in the
government's hands, facing a siege.

Government propagandists spread the word that the material energy
engines were not safe. eports were broadcast that on at least two
occasions the engines had blown up, killing the men who operated them.

ut this propaganda failed to gain credence, for in the cities that were
in the rebel hands, technicians were at work manufacturing and setting
up the material engines. emonstrations were given. The people saw them,
saw what enormous power they developed.

                                   

uss age stared incredulously at the television screen. t seemed to be
shifting back and forth. ne second it held the distorted view of
Satellite City on Ganymede, and the net second the view of umbled, icy
desert somewhere outside the city.

ook here, Greg, he said. Something's wrong.

Greg Manning turned away from the calculator where he had been working
and stared at the screen.

ow long has it been acting that way? he asked.

ust started, said uss.

Greg straightened and glanced down the row of television machines. Some
of them were dead, their switches closed, but on the screens of many of
the others was the same effect as on this machine. Their operators were
working frustratedly at the controls, trying to focus the image, bring
it into sharp relief.

Can't seem to get a thing, sir, said one of the men.  was working on
the fueling station out on o, and the screen ust went haywire.

Mine seems to be all right, said another man. 've had it on Sandebar
for the last couple of hours and there's nothing wrong.

A swift check revealed one fact. The machines, when trained on the
ovian worlds, refused to function. Anywhere else in space, however,
they worked perfectly.

uss stoked and lit his pipe, snapped off his machine and swung around
in the operator's chair.

Somebody's playing hell with us out around upiter, he stated calmly.

've been epecting something like this, said Greg.  have been
afraid of this ever since Craven blanketed us out of the nterplanetary
building.

                                   

e really must have something this time, uss agreed. e's blanketing
out the entire ovian system. There's a space field of low intensity
surrounding all of upiter, enclosing all the moons. e keeps shifting
the intensity so that, even though we can force our way through his
field, the irregular variations make it impossible to line up anything.
t works, in principle, ust as effectively as if we couldn't get
through at all.

Greg whistled soundlessly through suddenly bared teeth.

That takes power, he said, and 'm afraid Craven has it. ower to
burn.

The collector field? asked uss.

Greg nodded. A field that sucks in radiant energy. Free energy that he
ust reaches out and grabs. And it doesn't depend on the Sun alone. t
probably makes use of every type of radiation in all of space.

uss slumped in his chair, smoking, his forehead wrinkled in thought.

f that's what he's got, he finally declared, he's going to be hard
to crack. e can suck in any radiant vibration form, any space
vibration. e can shift them around, break them down and build them up.
e can discharge them, direct them. e's got a vibration plant that's
the handiest little war machine that ever eisted.

Greg suddenly wheeled and walked to a wall cabinet. From it he took a
bo and, opening it, lifted out a tiny mechanism.

e chuckled deep in his throat. The mechanical shadow. The little
machine that always tells us where Craven isas long as he's wearing
his glasses.

e always wears them, said uss crisply. e's blind as a bat without
them.

Greg set the machine down on the table. When we find Craven, we'll find
the contraption that's blanketing upiter and its moons.

ials spun and needles uivered. apidly uss otted down the readings
on a sheet of paper. At the calculator, he tapped keys, depressed the
activator. The machine hummed and snarled and chuckled.

uss glanced at the result imprinted on the paper roll.

Craven is out near upiter, he announced. About , miles distant
from its surface, in a plane normal to the Sun's rays.

A spaceship, suggested Greg.

uss nodded. That's the only answer.

The two men looked at one another.

That's something we can get hold of, said Greg.

e walked to the ship controls and lowered himself into the pilot's
chair. A hand came out and hauled back a lever.

The nvincible moved.

From the engine rooms came the whine of the gigantic power plant as it
built up and maintained the gravity concentration center suddenly
created in front of the ship.

uss, standing beside Greg at the control panel, looked out into space
and marveled. They were flashing through space, their speed building up
at a breathtaking rate, yet they had no real propulsion power. The
discovery of the gravity concentrator had outdated such a method of
driving a spaceship. nstead, they were falling, hurtling downward into
the yawning maw of an artificial gravity field. And such a method made
for speed, terrible speed.

upiter seemed to leap at them. t became a great crimson and yellow
ball that filled almost half the vision plate.

                                   

The nvincible's speed was slacking off, slower and slower, until it
barely crawled in comparison to its former speed.

Slowly they circled upiter's great girth, staring out of the vision
port for a sight of Craven's ship. They were nearing the position the
little mechanical shadow had indicated.

There it is, said uss suddenly, almost breathlessly.

Far out in space, tiny, almost like a dust mote against the great bulk
of the monster planet, rode a tiny light. Slowly the nvincible
crawled inward. The mote of light became a gleaming silver ship, a
mighty shipone that was fully as large as the nvincible

That's it all right, said Greg. They're lying behind a log out here
raising hell with our television apparatus. Maybe we better tickle them
a little bit and see what they have.

ising from the control board, he went to another control panel. uss
remained standing in front of the vision plate, staring down at the
ship out in space.

ehind him came a shrill howl from the power plant. The nvincible
staggered slightly. A beam of deep indigo lashed across space, a finger
suddenly abbing at the other ship.

Space was suddenly colored, for thousands of miles, as the beam struck
Craven's ship and seemed to eplode in a blast of daling indigo light.
The ship reeled under the impact of the blow, reeled and weaved in space
as the beam struck it and delivered to it the mighty power of the
screaming engines back in the engine room.

What happened? Greg screamed above the roar.

uss shrugged his shoulders. ou arred him a little. ushed him
through space for several hundred miles. Made him know something had hit
him, but it didn't seem to do any damage.

That was pure cosmic  gave him Five billion horsepowerand it ust
staggered him

e's got a space lens that absorbs the energy, said uss. The lens
concentrates it and pours it into a receiving chamber, probably a huge
photocell. obody yet has burned out one of those things on a closed
circuit.

Greg wrinkled his brow, perpleed. What he must have is a special field
of some sort that lowers the wavelength and the intensity. e's getting
natural cosmics all the time and taking care of them.

That wouldn't be much of a trick, uss pointed out. ut when he takes
care of cosmics backed by five billion horsepower ... that's something
else

Greg grinned wickedly. 'm going to hand him a long heat radiation. f
his field shortens that any, he'll have radio beam and that will blow
photocells all to hell.

e stabbed viciously at the keys on the board and once again the shrill
howl of the engines came from the rear of the ship. A lance of red
splashed out across space and touched the other ship. Again space was
lit, this time with a crimson glow.

                                   

uss shook his head. othing doing.

Greg sat down and looked at uss. Funny thing about this. They ust sat
there and let us throw two charges at them, took everything we gave them
and never tried to hand it back.

Maybe they haven't anything to hand us, uss suggested hopefully.

They must have. Craven wouldn't take to space with ust a purely
defensive weapon. e knew we'd find him and he'd have a fight on his
hands.

uss found his pipe was dead. Snapping his lighter, he applied flame to
the blackened tobacco. Walking slowly to the wall cabinet, he lifted two
other boes out, set them on the table and took from them two other
mechanical shadows. e turned them on and leaned close, watching the
spinning dials, the uivering needles.

Greg, he whispered, Chambers and Stutsman are there in that ship with
Craven ook, their shadows register identical with the one that spotted
Craven.

 suspected as much, Greg replied. We got the whole pack cornered out
here. f we can ust get rid of them, the whole war would be won in one
stroke.

uss lifted a stricken face from the row of tiny mechanisms. This is
our big chance. We may never get it again. The net hour could decide
who is going to win.

Greg rose from the chair and stood before the control board. Grimly he
punched a series of keys. The engines howled again. Greg twisted a dial
and the howl rose into a shrill scream.

From the nvincible another beam lashed out ... another and another.
Space was speared with beam after beam hurtling from the great ship.

Swiftly the beams went through the range of radiation, through radio and
short radio, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, ray, the gammas
and the cosmicsa terrific flood of billions of horsepower.

Craven's ship buckled and careened under the lashing impacts of the
bombardment, but it seemed unhurt

Greg's face was bleaker than usual as he turned from the board to look
at uss.

We've used everything we have, he said, and he's stopped them all. We
can't touch him.

                                   

uss shivered. The control room suddenly seemed chilly with a
frightening kind of cold.

e's carrying photocells and several thousand tons of accumulator
stacks. ot much power left in them. e could pour a billion horsepower
into them for hours and still have room for more.

Greg nodded wearily. All we've been doing is feeding him.

The engines were humming uietly now, singing the low song of power held
in leash.

ut then they screamed like a bu saw biting into an ironhard stick of
white oak. Screamed in a single, frightful agony as they threw into the
protecting wall that enclosed the nvincible all the power they could
develop.

The air of the ship was instantaneously charged with a hay, bluish
glow, and the sharp, stinging odor of oone filled the ship.

                                   

utside, an enormous burst of bluewhite flame splashed and spattered
around the nvincible. iving lightning played in solid, snapping
sheets around the vision port and ran in trickling blaing fire across
the plates.

uss cried out and backed away, holding his arm before his eyes. t was
as if he had looked into a nova of energy eploding before his eyes.

n the instant the scream died and the splash of terrific fire had
vanished. nly a rapidly dying glow remained.

What was it? asked uss daedly. What happened? Ten engines every one
of them capable of over five billion horsepower and every one of them
screaming

Craven, said Greg grimly. e let us have everything he had. e simply
drained his accumulator stacks and threw it all into our face. ut he's
done now. That was his only shot. e'll have to build up power now and
that will take a while. ut we couldn't have taken much more.

Stalemate, said uss. We can't hurt him, he can't hurt us.

ot by a damn sight, declared Greg.  still have a trick or two in
mind.

e tried them. From the nvincible a fiftybillionhorsepower bolt of
living light and fire sprang out as all ten engines thundered with an
insane voice that racked the ship.

Fireworks eploded in space when the bolt struck Craven's ship. Screen
after screen eploded in glittering, flaming sparks, but the ship rode
the lashing charge, finally halted the thrust of power. The beam glowed
faintly, died out.

erspiration streamed down Greg's face as he bent over a calculator and
constructed the formula for a magnetic field. e sent out a field of
such unimaginable intensity that it would have drawn any berylsteel
within a mile of it into a hard, compact mass. Even the nvincible, a
hundred miles away, lurched under the strain. ut Craven's ship, after
the first wild erk, did not move. A curious soft glow spread out from
the ship, veered sharply and disappeared in the magnetic field.

Greg swore softly. e's cutting it down as fast as  try to build it
up, he eplained, and  can't move it any nearer.

From Craven's ship lashed out another thunderbolt and once again the
engines screamed in terrible unison as they poured power into the ship's
triple screen. The first screen stopped all material things. The second
stopped radiations by refracting them into the fourth dimension. The
third shield was akin to the antientropy field, which stopped all
matter ... and yet the ten engines bellowed like things insane as Craven
struck with flaming bolts, utiliing the power he had absorbed from the
fifty billion horsepower Greg had thrown at him.

There was anger in Greg Manning's face ... a terrible anger. is fists
knotted and he shook them at the gleaming ship that lay far down near
upiter.

've got one trick left, he shouted, almost as if he epected Craven
to hear. ust one trick. amn you, see if you can stop this one

e set up the pattern on the board and punched the activating lever. The
ten engines thrummed with power. Then the howling died away.

Four times they screamed and four times they ebbed into a gentle hum.

Get on the navigation controls yelled Greg. e ready to give the
ship all you've got.

Greg leaped for the control chair, grasped the acceleration lever.

ow, growled Greg, look out, Craven, we're coming at you

Greg, teeth gritted, slammed the acceleration over.

Suddenly all space wrenched horribly with a nauseating, terrible thud
that seemed to strain at the very anchors of the niverse.




CATE EGTEE


upiter and the ovian worlds leaped suddenly backward, turned swiftly
green, then blue, and faded in an instant into violet. The Sun spun
craily through space, retreating, dimming to a tiny rubytinted star.

The giant generators in the nvincible hummed louder now, continually
louder, a steelthroated roar that trembled through every plate, through
every girder, through every bit of metal in the ship.

The ship itself was plunging spaceward, streaking like a runaway star
for the depths of space beyond the Solar System. And behind it, caught
tight, gripped and held, Craven's ship trailed at the end of a tractor
field that bound it to the spacerocketing nvincible.

The acceleration compensator, functioning perfectly, had taken up the
slack as the ship had plunged from a standing start into a speed that
neared the pace of light. ut it had never been built to stand such
sudden, intense acceleration, and for an instant uss and Greg seemed
to be crushed by a mighty weight that struck at them. The sensation
swiftly lifted as the compensator took up the load.

                                   

Greg shook his head, flinging the trickling perspiration from his eyes.

 hope their compensator worked as well as ours, he said.

f it didn't, declared uss, we're towing a shipload of dead men.

uss glanced at the speed dial. They were almost touching the speed of
light. e hasn't cut down our speed yet.

We threw him off his balance. is drive depends largely on the mass of
some planet as a body to take up the reaction of his ship. upiter is
the ideal body for that ... but he's leaving upiter behind. e has to
do something soon or it'll be too late.

e's getting less energy, too, said uss. We're retreating from his
main sources of energy, the Sun and upiter. Almost the speed of light
and that would cut down his energy intake terrifically. e has to use
what he's got in his accumulators, and after that last blast at us, they
must be nearly drained.

As uss watched, the speed needle fell off slightly. uss held his
breath. t edged back slowly, creeping. The speed was being cut down.

Craven is using whatever power he has, he said. They're alive back
there, all right. e's trying to catch hold of upiter and make its
gravity work for him.

The nvincible felt the strain of the other ship now. Felt it as
Craven poured power into his drive, fighting to get free of the
invisible hawser that had trapped him, fighting against being dragged
into outer space at the tailend of a mighty craft heading spaceward
with frightening speed.

Girders groaned in the nvincible, the engines moaned and throbbed.
The speed needle fell back, creeping down the dial, slowly, unwillingly,
resisting any drop in speed. ut Craven was cutting it down. And as he
cut it, he was able to absorb more energy with his collector lens. ut
he was fighting two things ... momentum and the steadily decreasing
gravitational pull of upiter and the Sun. The Sun's pull was dwindling
slowly, upiter's rapidly.

The needle still crept downward.

What's his point of euality to us? demanded Greg. Will we make it?

uss shook his head. Won't know for hours. e'll be able to slow us
up ... maybe he'll even stop us or be able to erk free, although 
doubt that. ut every minute takes him farther away from his main source
of power, the Solar System's radiation. e could collect power anywhere
in space, you know, but the best place to collect it is near large
radiant bodies.

uss continued to crouch over the dial, begrudging every backward
flicker of the needle.

This was the last play, the final hand. f they could drag Craven and
his ship away from the Solar System, maroon him deep in space, far
removed from any source of radiation, they would win, for they could go
back and finish the work of smashing nterplanetary.

ut if Craven wonif he could halt their mad dash for space, if he
could shake freethey'd never have another chance. e would be studying
that field they had wrapped around him, be ready for it net time, might
even develop one like it and use it on the nvincible. f Craven could
win his way back to the Sun, he would be stronger than they were, could
top them in power, shatter all their plans, and once again the worlds
would bow to nterplanetary and Spencer Chambers.

uss watched the meter. The speed was little more than ten miles a
second now and dropping rapidly. e sat motionless, hunched, sucking at
his dead pipe, listening to the thrumming of the generators.

                                   

f we only had a margin, he groaned. f we ust had a few more
horsepower. ust a few. ut we're wide open. Every engine is developing
everything it can

Greg tapped him on the shoulder, gently. uss turned his head and looked
into the face of his friend, a face as bleak as ever, but with a hint of
smile in the corners of the eyes.

Why not let upiter help us? he asked. e could be a lot of help.

uss stared for a moment, uncomprehending. Then with a sob of gladness
he reached out a hand, shoved over a lever. Mirrors of antientropy
shifted, assumed different angles, and the nvincible sheered off.
They were no longer retreating directly from the Sun, but at an angle
uartering off across the Solar System.

Greg grinned. We're falling behind upiter now. etting upiter run
away from us as he circles his orbit, following the Sun. Adds miles per
second to our velocity of retreat, even if it doesn't show on the dial.

The cosmic tug of war went on, grimlytwo ships straining, fighting
each other, one seeking to escape, the other straining to snake the
second ship into the maw of open, hostile space.

The speed was down to five miles a second, then a fraction lower. The
needle was flickering now, impossible to decide whether it was dropping
or not. And in the engine rooms, ten great generators howled in their
attempt to make that needle move up the dial again.

uss lit his pipe, his eyes not leaving the dial. The needle was
creeping lower again. own to three miles a second now.

e puffed clouds of smoke and considered. Saturn fortunately was ninety
degrees around in his orbit. n the present course, only eptune
remained between them and free space. luto was far away, but even if it
had been, it really wouldn't count, for it was small and had little
attraction.

n a short while Ganymede and Callisto would be moving around on the far
side of upiter and that might help. Everything counted so much now.

The dial was down to two miles a second and there it hung. ung and
stayed. uss watched it with narrowed eyes. y this time Craven
certainly would have given up much hope of help from upiter. f the big
planet couldn't have helped him before, it certainly couldn't now. n
another hour or two Earth would transit the Sun and that would cut down
the radiant energy to some degree. ut in the meantime Craven was
loading his photocells and accumulators, was laying up a power reserve.
As a last desperate resort he would use that power, in a final attempt
to break away from the nvincible.

uss waited for that attempt. There was nothing that could be done about
it. The engines were developing every watt of power that could be urged
out of them. f Craven had the power to break away, he would break
away ... that was all there would be to it.

An hour passed and the needle crept up a fraction of a point. uss was
still watching the dial, his mind foggy with concentration.

                                   

Suddenly the nvincible shuddered and seemed to totter in space, as if
something, some mighty force, had struck the ship a terrific blow. The
needle swung swiftly backward, reached one mile a second, dipped to half
a mile.

uss sat bolt upright, holding his breath, his teeth clenched with death
grip upon the pipestem.

Craven had blasted with everything he had e had used every last
trickle of power in the accumulators ... all the power he had been
storing up.

uss leaped from the chair and raced to the periscopic mirror.
Stooping, he stared into it. Far back in space, like a silver bauble,
swung Craven's ship. t swung back and forth in space, like a mighty,
cosmic pendulum. reathlessly he watched. The ship was still in the grip
of the space field

Greg, he shouted, we've got him

e raced back to the control panel, snapped a glance at the speed dial.
The needle was rising rapidly now, a full mile a second. Within another
fifteen minutes, it had climbed to a mile and a half. The nvincible
was starting to go places

The engines still howled, straining, shrieking, roaring their defiance.

n an hour the needle indicated the speed of four miles a second. Two
hours later it was ten and rising visibly as upiter fell far behind and
the Sun became little more than a glowing cinder.

uss swung the controls to provide side acceleration and the two ships
swung far to the rear of eptune. They would pass that massive planet at
the safe distance of a full hundred million miles.

e won't even make a pass at it, said Greg. e knows he's licked.

robably trying to store some more power, suggested uss.

Sweet chance he has to do that, declared Greg. ook at that needle
walk, will you? We'll hit the speed of light in a few more hours and
after that he may ust as well shut off his lens. There ust won't be
any radiation for him to catch.

Craven didn't make a try at eptune. The planet was far away when they
intersected its orbit ... furthermore, a wall of darkness had closed in
about the ships. They were going three times as fast as light and the
speed was still accelerating

our after hour, day after day, the nvincible and its trailing
captive sped doggedly outward into space. ut into the absolute wastes
of interstellar space, where the stars were flecks of light, like tiny
eyes watching from very far away.

                                   

uss lounged in the control chair and stared out the vision plate. There
was nothing to see, nothing to do. There hadn't been anything to see or
do for days. The controls were locked at maimum and the engines still
hammered their roaring song of speed and power. efore them stretched an
empty gulf that probably never before had been traversed by any
intelligence, certainly not by man.

ut into the mystery of interstellar space. nly it didn't seem
mysterious. t was very commonplace and ordinary, almost monotonous.
uss gripped his pipe and chuckled.

There had been a day when men had maintained one couldn't go faster than
light. Also, men had claimed that it would be impossible to force nature
to give up the secret of material energy. ut here they were, speeding
along faster than light, their engines roaring with the power of
material energy.

They were plowing a new space road, staking out a new path across the
deserts of space, pioneering far beyond the 'last frontier.'

Greg's steps sounded across the room. We've gone a long way, uss.
Maybe we better begin to slow down a bit.

es, agreed uss. e leaned forward and grasped the controls. We'll
slow down now, he said.

Sudden silence smote the ship. Their ears, accustomed for days to the
throaty roarings of the engines, rang with the torture of no sound.

ong minutes and then new sounds began to be heard ... the soft humming
of the single engine that provided power for the interior apparatus and
the maintenance of the outer screens.

Soon as we slow down below the speed of light, said Greg, we'll throw
the televisor on Craven's ship and learn what we can about his
apparatus. o use trying it now, for we couldn't use it, because we're
in the same space condition it uses in normal operation.

n fact, laughed uss, we can't do much of anything ecept move.
Energies simply can't pass through this space we're in. We're marooned.

Greg sat down in a chair, gaed solemnly at uss.

ust what was our top speed? he demanded.

uss grinned. Ten thousand times the speed of light, he said.

Greg whistled soundlessly. A long way from home.

                                   

Far away, the stars were tiny pinpoints, like little crystals shining by
the reflection of a light. inpoints of light and shimmering masses of
lacy silver ... star dust that seemed ghostly and strange, but was in
reality the massing of many million mighty stars. And great empty black
spaces where there was not a single light, where the dark went on and on
and did not stop.

Greg ehaled his breath softly. Well, we're here.

Wherever that might be, amended uss.

There were no familiar constellations, not a single familiar star. Every
sign post of the space they had known was wiped out.

There really aren't any brilliant stars, said uss. one at all. We
must be in a sort of hole in space, a place that's relatively empty of
any stars.

Greg nodded soberly. Good thing we have those mechanical shadows.
Without them we'd never find our way back home. ut we have several that
will lead us back.

utside the vision panel, they could see Craven's ship. Freed now of the
space field, it was floating slowly, still under the grip of the
momentum they had built up in their dash across space. t was so close
that they could see the lettering across its bow.

So they call it the nterplanetarian, said uss.

Greg nodded. Guess it's about time we talk to them. 'm afraid they're
getting pretty nervous.

                                   

o you have any idea where we are? demanded udwig Stutsman.

Craven shook his head. o more idea than you have. Manning snaked us
across billions of miles, clear out of the Solar System into
interstellar space. Take a look at those stars and you get some idea.

Spencer Chambers stroked his gray mustache, asked calmly: What do you
figure our chances are of getting back?

That's something we'll know more about later, said Craven. oesn't
look too bright right now. 'm not worrying about that. What 'm
wondering about is what Manning and age are going to do now that they
have us out here.

 thought you'd be, said a voice that came out of clear air.

They stared at the place from which the voice had seemed to come. There
was a slight refraction in the air then, swiftly, a man took shape. t
was Manning. e stood before them, smiling.

ello, Manning, said Craven.  figured you'd pay us a call when you
got around to it.

ook here, snarled Stutsman, but he stopped when Chambers' hand fell
upon his shoulder, gripped it hard.

Got plenty of air? asked Greg.

Air? Sure. Atmosphere machines working perfectly, Craven replied.

Fine, said Greg. ow about food and water? lenty of both?

lenty, said Craven.

ook here, Manning, broke in Chambers, where's all this uestioning
leading? What have you got up your sleeve?

ust wanted to be sure, Greg told him. Would hate to have you fellows
starve on me, or go thirsty. Wouldn't want to come back and find you all
dead.

Come back? asked Chambers wonderingly. 'm afraid  don't understand.
s this a oke of some sort?

o oke, said Greg grimly.  thought you might have guessed. 'm
going to leave you here.

eave us here? roared Stutsman.

eep your shirt on, snapped Greg. ust for a while, until we can go
back to the Solar System and finish a little ob we're doing. Then we'll
come back and get you.

Craven grimaced.  thought it would be something like that. e
suinted at Manning through the thick lenses. ou never miss a bet, do
you?

Greg laughed.  try not to.

A little silence fell upon the three men and Manning's image.

Greg broke it. ow about your energy collector? he asked Craven. Will
it maintain the ship out here? ou get cosmic rays. ot too much else,
'm afraid.

Craven grinned wryly. ou're right, but we can get along. The
accumulators are practically drained, though, and we won't be able to
store anything. Would you mind shooting us over ust a little power?
Enough to charge the accumulators a little for emergency use.

e looked over his shoulder, almost apprehensively.

There might be an emergency out here, you know. obody knows anything
about this place.

'll give you a little power, Greg agreed.

Thank you very much, said Craven, half in mockery. o doubt you think
yourself uite smart, Manning, getting us out here. ou know you have us
stranded, that we can't collect more than enough power to live on.

That's why  did it, Greg said, and vanished.




CATE ETEE


Craven watched the nvincible gather speed and tear swiftly through
the black, saw it grow tiny and then disappear entirely, either
swallowed by the distance or snapping into the strange superspace that
eisted beyond the speed of light.

e turned from the window, chuckling.

Stutsman snarled at him: What's so funny?

The scientist glared at the wolfish face and without speaking, walked to
the desk and sat down. e reached for pencil and paper.

Chambers walked over to watch him.

ou've found something, octor, he said uietly.

Craven laughed, throatily. es,  have. 've found a lot. Manning
thinks he can keep us out here, but he's wrong. We'll be in the Solar
System less than a week after he gets there.

Chambers stifled a gasp, tried to speak calmly. ou mean this?

f course  mean it.  don't waste my time with foolish okes.

ou have the secret of material energy?

ot that, the scientist growled, but  have something else as
valuable.  have the secret of Manning's drive:  know what it is that
enables him to eceed the speed of light ... to go ten thousand times as
fast as light ... the ord knows how much faster if he wanted to.

o ordinary drive would do that, said Chambers. t would take more
than power to make a ship go that fast.

ou bet your life it would, and Manning is the boy who's got it. e
uses a space field.  think  can duplicate it.

And how long will it take you to do this work?

About a week, Craven told him. erhaps a little longer, perhaps a
little less. ut once we go, we'll go as fast as Manning does. We'll be
short on power, but  think  can do something about that, too.

Chambers took a chair beside the desk. ut do we know the way home?

We can find it, said Craven.

ut there are no familiar constellations, obected Chambers. e
dragged us out so far that there isn't a single star that any one of us
can identify.

 said 'd find the Solar System, Craven declared impatiently, and 
will. Manning started out for it, didn't he?  saw the way he went. The
Sun is a type G star and all 'll do is look for a type G star.

ut there may be more than one type G star, obected the financier.

robably are, Craven agreed, but there are other ways of finding the
Sun and identifying it.

e volunteered no further information, went back to work with the pad
and pencil. Chambers rose wearily from his chair.

Tell me when you know what we can do, he said.

Sure, Craven grunted.

                                   

That's the Sun, said Craven. That faint star between those two
brighter ones.

Are you sure of it? demanded Stutsman.

f course.  don't make blunders.

t's the only type G star in that direction, suggested Chambers,
helpfully.

ot that, either, declared Craven. n fact, there are several type G
stars.  eamined them all and  know 'm right.

ow do you know? challenged Stutsman.

Spectroscopic eamination. That collector field of ours gathers energy
ust like a burning glass. ou've seen a burning glass, haven't you?

e stared at Stutsman, directing the uestion at him.

Stutsman shuffled awkwardly, unhappily.

Well, Craven went on,  used that for a telescope. Gathered the light
from the suns and analyed it. f course it didn't act like a real
telescope, produce an image or anything like that, but it was ideal for
spectroscopic work.

They waited for him to eplain. Finally, he continued:

All of the stars  eamined were ust type G stars, nothing else, but
there was a difference in one of them. First, the spectroscope showed
lines of reflected light passing through oygen and hydrogen, water
vapor and carbon dioide. ure planetary phenomena, never found on a
star itself. Also it showed that a certain per cent of the light was
polaried. ow remember that  eamined it for a long time and  found
out something else from the length of observation which convinces me.
The light varied with a periodic irregularity. The chronometers aren't
working eactly right out here, so  can't give you any eplanation in
terms of hours. ut  find a number of regularly recurring changes in
light intensity and character ... and that proves the presence of a
number of planetary bodies circling the star. That's the only way one
could eplain the fluctuations for the Gtype star is a steady type. t
doesn't vary greatly and has no light fluctuations to speak of. ot like
the Cepheid and Mira types.

And that proves it's our Sun? asked Chambers.

Craven nodded. Fairly definitely, 'd say.

ow far away is it? Stutsman wanted to know.

                                   

Craven snorted. ou would ask something like that.

ut, declared Stutsman, there are ways of measuring how far a star is
away from any point, measuring both the distance and the sie of the
star.

kay, agreed Craven, you find me something solid and within reach
that's measurable. Something, preferably, about  million miles or so
across. Then 'll tell you how far we are from the Sun. This ship is not
in an orbit. t's not fied in space.  have no accurate way of
measuring distances and angles simultaneously and accurately. Especially
angles as small as these would be.

Craven and Stutsman glared at one another.

t's a long way however you look at it, the financier said. f we're
going to get there, we'll have to start as soon as possible. ow soon
can we start, octor?

ery soon.  have the gravity concentration field developed and
Manning left me ust enough power to get a good start. e chuckled,
took off his glasses, wiped the lenses and put them back on again.
magine him giving me that power

ut after we use up that power, what are we going to do? demanded
Chambers. This collector lens of yours won't furnish us enough to keep
going.

ou're right, Craven conceded, but we'll be able to get more. We'll
build up what speed we can and then we'll shut off the drive and let
momentum carry us along. n the meantime our collector will gather power
for us. We're advancing toward the source of radiation now, instead of
away from it. ut here, where there's little gravity stress, fewer
conflicting lines of gravitation, we'll be able to spread out the field,
widen it, make it thousands of miles across. And the new photocells
will be a help as well.

ow are the photocells coming? asked Chambers.

Craven grinned. We'll have a bank of them in within a few hours, and
replace the others as fast as we can.  have practically the whole crew
at work on them. Manning doesn't know it, but he found the limit of
those photocells when he was heaving energy at us back in the Solar
System. e blistered them.  wouldn't have thought it possible, but it
was. ou have to hand it to Manning and age. They are a couple of smart
men.

To the eye there was only one slight difference between the old cells
and the new ones. The new type cell, when on no load, appeared milky
white, whereas the old cells on no load were silvery. The granular
surface of the new units was responsible for the difference in
appearance, for each minute section of the surface was covered with even
more minute metallic heagonal pyramids and prisms.

ust a little matter of variation in the alloy, Craven eplained.
Crystaliation of the alloy, forming those little prisms and pyramids.
As a result, you get a surface thousands of times greater than in the
old type. elps you absorb every bit of the energy.

                                   

The nterplanetarian arrowed swiftly starward, driving ahead with
terrific momentum while the collector lens, sweeping up the oncoming
radiations, charged the great banks of accumulators. The Gtype star
toward which they were heading was still pale, but the two brighter
stars to either side blaed like fiery ewels against the black of
space.

ou say we'll be only a week or so behind Manning? asked Chambers.

Craven looked at the financier, his eyes narrowed behind the heavy
lenses. e sucked in his loose lips and turned once again to the control
board.

erhaps a little longer, he admitted finally. We're losing time,
having to go along on momentum in order to collect power. ut the nearer
we get to those stars, the more power we'll have and we'll be able to
move faster.

Chambers drummed idly on the arm of his chair, thinking.

erhaps there's time yet, he said, half to himself. With the power
we'll have within the Solar System, we can stop Manning and the
revolution. We can gain control again.

                                   

Craven was silent, watching the dials.

Manning might even pass us on the way back to look for us, Chambers
went on. e thinks we're still out there. e wouldn't epect to find us
where we are, light years from where we started.

Craven shot him a curious look.  wouldn't be too sure of that. Manning
has a string of some sort tied to us. e's got us tagged ... good and
proper. e's always been able to find us again, no matter where we were.
 have a hunch he'll find us again, even way out here.

Chambers shrugged his shoulders. t really doesn't matter. ust so we
get close enough to the Sun so we can load those accumulators and am
the photocells full. With a load like that we can beat him hands down.

The financier fell into a silence. e stared out of the vision plate,
watching the stars. Still far away, but so much nearer than they had
been.

is brain hummed with dreams. ld dreams, revived again, old dreams of
conuest and of empire, dreams of a power that held a solar system in
its grip.

Craven broke his chain of thoughts. Where's our friend Stutsman? 
haven't seen him around lately.

Chambers chuckled goodnaturedly. e's sulking. e seems to have gotten
the idea neither one of us likes him. e's been spending most of his
time back in the engine room with the crew.

Were you talking about me? asked a silky voice.

They spun around to see Stutsman standing in the doorway of the control
room. is face was twisted into a wolfish grin and in his right hand he
held a heat gun.

Chambers' voice was sharp, like the note of a clanging bell. What's
this?

Stutsman's face twisted into an even more eaggerated grin. This, he
said, is mutiny. 'm taking over e laughed at them.

o use calling the crew. They're with me.

amn you shouted Chambers, taking a step forward. e halted as
Stutsman erked the pistol up.

Forget it, Chambers. ou're ust second man from now on. Maybe not even
second man. ou tried out this dictator business and you bungled it. ou
went soft. ou're taking orders from me from now on. o uestions, no
back talk. ou do as  say and maybe you won't get hurt.

ou're mad, Stutsman cried Chambers. ou can't get away with this.

Stutsman barked out a brittle laugh. Who is going to stop me?

The people, Chambers shouted at him. The people will. They won't
allow this. When you get back to the Solar System ...

Stutsman growled, stepping toward Chambers, pistol leveled. The people
won't have anything to say about this. 'll rule the Solar System the
way  want to. There won't be anyone else who'll have a thing to say
about it. So you dreamed of empire, did you? ou dreamed of a solar
dictatorship. Well, watch me 'll build a real empire. ut 'll be the
head of it ... not you.

Craven sat down in his chair, crossed his knees. ust what do you plan
to do, ictator Stutsman?

                                   

Stutsman fairly foamed at the mouth over the insolence of Craven's
voice. 'll smash Manning first. 'll wipe him out. This ship will do
it. ou said yourself it would. ou have ten times the power he has. And
then ...

Craven raised a hand and waved him into silence. So you plan to reach
the Solar System, do you? ou plan to meet Manning, and destroy his
ship. ice plan.

What's wrong with it? challenged Stutsman.

othing, said Craven calmly. Absolutely nothing at all ... ecept
that we may never reach the Solar System

Stutsman seemed to sag. The wolfish snarl on his lips drooped. is eyes
stared. Then with an effort he braced himself.

What do you mean? Why can't we? e gestured toward the vision plate,
toward the tiny yellow star between the two brighter stars.

That, said Craven, isn't our Sun. t has planets, but it isn't our
Sun.

Chambers stepped uickly to Craven, reached out a hand and hoisted him
from the chair, shook him.

ou must be oking That has to be the Sun

Craven shrugged free of Chambers' clutch, spoke in an even voice. 
never oke. We made a mistake, that's all.  hadn't meant to tell you
yet.  had intended to get in close to the star and take on a full load
of power and then try to locate our Sun. ut 'm afraid it's a hopeless
task.

A hopeless task? shrieked Stutsman. ou are trying to trick me. This
is put up between the two of you. That's the Sun over there.  know it
is

t isn't, said Craven. Manning tricked us. e started off in the
wrong direction. e made us think he was going straight back to the
Solar System, but he didn't. e circled and went in some other
direction.

The scientist eyed Stutsman calmly. Stutsman's knuckles were white with
the grip he had upon the gun.

We're lost, Craven told him, looking suarely at him. We may never
find the Solar System




CATE TWET


The revolution was over. nterplanetary officials and army heads had
fled to the sanctuary of Earth. nterplanetary was ended ... ended
forever, for on every world, including Earth, material energy engines
were humming. The people had power to burn, to throw away, power so
cheap that it was practically worthless as a commodity, but invaluable
as a way to a new life, a greater life, a fuller life ... a broader
destiny for the human race.

nterplanetary stocks were worthless. The mighty power plants on enus
and Mercury were idle. The only remaining tangible asset were the fleets
of spaceships used less than a month before to ship the accumulators to
the outer worlds, to bring them Sunward for recharging.

atents protecting the rights to the material energy engines had been
obtained from every government throughout the Solar System. ew
governments were being formed on the wreckage of the old. ohn Moore
Mallory already had been inaugurated as president of the ovian
confederacy. The elections on Mars and enus would be held within a
week.

Mercury, its usefulness gone with the smashing of the accumulator trade,
had been abandoned. o human foot now trod its surface. ts mighty domes
were empty. t went its way, as it had gone for billions of years, a
little burned out, worthless planet, ignored and shunned. For a brief
moment it had known the conuering tread of mankind, had played its part
in the commerce of the worlds, but now it had reverted to its former
state ... a lonely wanderer of the regions near the Sun, a pariah among
the other planets.

                                   

ussell age looked across the desk at Gregory Manning. e heaved a sigh
and dug the pipe out of his acket pocket.

t's finished, Greg, he said.

Greg nodded solemnly, watching uss fill the bowl and apply the match.

Ecept for the small crew, they were alone in the nvincible. ohn
Moore Mallory and the others were on their own worlds, forming their own
governments, carrying out the dictates of the people, men who would go
down in solar history.

The nvincible hung ust off Callisto. uss looked out at the mighty
moon, saw the lonely stretches of its icebound surface, saw the silvery
spot that was the dome of anthoor.

All done, said Greg, ecept for one thing.

Go out and get Chambers and the others, said uss, puffing at the
pipe.

Greg nodded. We may as well get started.

uss rose slowly, went to the wall cabinet and lifted out a bo, the
mechanical shadow with its tiny space field surrounding the fleck of
steel that would lead them to the nterplanetarian. Carefully he
lifted the machine from its resting place and set it on the desk.
ending over it, he watched the dials.

Suddenly he whistled. Greg, they've moved They aren't where we left
them

Greg sprang to his side and stared at the readings. They're moving
farther away from us ... out into space. Where can they be going?

uss straightened, scowling, pulling at the pipe. They probably found
another Gtype star, and are heading for that. They must think it is old
Sol.

That sounds like it, said Greg. We spun all over the map to throw
Craven off and looped several times so he'd lose all sense of direction.
aturally he would be lost.

ut he's evidently got something, uss pointed out. We left him
marooned ... dead center, out where he didn't have too much radiation
and couldn't get leverage on any single body. et he's movingand
getting farther away all the time.

e solved our gravitation concentration screen, said Greg. e tricked
us into giving him power to build it.

The two men looked at one another for a long minute.

Well, said uss, that's that. Craven and Chambers and Stutsman. The
three villains. All lost in space. eading for the wrong star.
opelessly lost. Maybe they'll never find their way back.

e stopped and relit his pipe. An aching silence fell in the room.

oetic ustice, said uss. ail and farewell.

Greg rubbed his fist indecisively along the desk.  can't do it, uss.
We took them out there. We marooned them. We have to get them back or 
couldn't sleep nights.

uss laughed uietly, watching the bleak face that stared at him. 
knew that's what you'd say.

e knocked out the pipe, crushed a fleck of burning tobacco with his
boot. ocketing the pipe, he walked to the control panel, sat down and
reached for the lever. The engines hummed louder and louder. The
nvincible darted spaceward.

                                   

t's too late now, said Chambers. y the time we reach that planetary
system and charge our accumulators, Manning and age will have
everything under control back in the Solar System. Even if we could
locate the star that was our Sun, we wouldn't have a chance to get there
in time.

Too bad, Craven said, and wagged his head, looking like a solemn owl.
Too bad. ictator Stutsman won't have a chance to strut his stuff.

Stutsman started to say something and thought better of it. e leaned
back in his chair. From his belt hung a heat pistol.

Chambers eyed the pistol with illconcealed disgust. There's no point
in playing soldier. We aren't going to try to upset your mutiny. So far
your taking over the ship hasn't made any difference to us ... so why
should we fight you?

t isn't going to make any difference either, said Craven. ecause
there are ust two things that will happen to us. We're either lost
forever, will never find our way back, will spend the rest of our days
wandering from star to star, or Manning will come out and take us by the
ear and lead us home again.

Chambers started, leaned forward and fastened his steely eyes on Craven.
o you really think he could find us?

 have no doubt of it, Craven replied.  don't know how he does it,
but 'm convinced he can. robably, however, he'll find that we are lost
and get rid of us that way.

o, said Chambers, you're wrong there. Manning wouldn't do that.
e'll come to get us.

 don't know why he should, snapped Craven.

ecause he's that sort of man, declared Chambers.

What you going to do when he does get out here? demanded Stutsman.
Fall on his neck and kiss him?

Chambers smiled, stroked his mustache. Why, no, he said.  imagine
we'll fight. We'll give him everything we've got and he'll do the same.
t wouldn't seem natural if we didn't.

ou're damned right we will, growled Stutsman. ecause 'm running
this show. ou seem to keep forgetting that. We have power enough, when
we get those accumulators filled, to wipe him out. And that is eactly
what 'm going to do.

Fine, said Craven, mockingly, ust fine. There's ust one thing you
forget. Manning is the only man who can lead us back to the Solar
System.

ell, stormed Stutsman, that doesn't make any difference. 'll find
my way back there some way.

ou're afraid of Manning, Chambers challenged.

Stutsman's hand went down to the heat pistol's grip. is eyes glaed and
his face twisted itself into utter hatred.  don't know why  keep on
letting you live. Craven is valuable to me.  can't kill him. ut you
aren't. ou aren't worth a damn to anyone.

                                   

Chambers matched his stare. Stutsman's hand dropped from the pistol and
he slouched to his feet, walked from the room.

Afraid of Manning e laughed, a hollow, gurgling laugh. Afraid of
Manning

ut he was.

Within his brain hammered a single sentence. Words he had heard Manning
speak as he watched over the television set at Manning's mocking
invitation. Words that beat into his brain and seared his reason and
made his soul shrivel and grow small.

Manning talking to Scorio. Talking to him matteroffactly, but grimly:
 promise you that we'll take care of Stutsman

Manning had taken Scorio and his gangsters one by one and sent them to
far corners of the Solar System. ne out to the dreaded ulcan Fleet,
one to the utpost, one to the Titan prison, and one to the hellhole
on esta, while Scorio had gone to a little mountain set in a enus
swamp. They hadn't a chance. They had been locked within a force shell
and shunted through millions of miles of space. o trial, no hearing ...
nothing. ust terrible, unrelenting udgment.

 promise you that we'll take care of Stutsman

                                   

Craven's only a few billion miles ahead now, said Gregory Manning.
With our margin of speed, we should overhaul him in a few more hours.
e is still short on power, but he's remedying that rapidly. e's
getting nearer to that sun every minute. unning in toward it as he is,
he tends to sweep up outpouring radiations. That helps him collect a
whole lot more than he would under ordinary circumstances.

uss, sitting before the controls, pipe clenched in his teeth, watching
the dials, nodded soberly.

All 'm afraid of, he said, is that he'll get too close to that sun
before we catch up with him. f he gets close enough so he can fill
those accumulators, he'll pack a bigger wallop than we do. t'll all be
in one bolt, of course, for his power isn't continuous like ours. e has
to collect it slowly. ut when he's really loaded, he can give us aces
and still win. 'd hate to take everything he could pack into those
accumulators.

Greg shuddered. So would .

The nvincible was eceeding the speed of light, was enveloped in the
mysterious darkness that characteried the speed. They could see nothing
outside the ship, for there was nothing to see. ut the tiny mechanical
shadow, occupying a place of honor on the navigation board, kept them
informed of the position and the distance of the nterplanetarian.

Greg lolled in his chair, watching uss.

 don't think we need to worry about him throwing the entire load of
the accumulators at us, he said. e wouldn't dare load those
accumulators to peak capacity. e's got to leave enough carrying
capacity in the cells to handle any olts we send him and he knows we
can send him plenty. e has to keep that handling margin at all times,
over and above what he takes in for power, because his absorption screen
is also a defensive screen. And he has to use some power to keep our
television apparatus out.

uss chuckled.  suppose, at that, we have him plenty worried.

The thunder of the engines filled the control room. For days now that
thunder had been in their ears. They had grown accustomed to it, now
hardly noticed it. Ten mighty engines, driving the nvincible at a
pace no other ship had ever obtained, ecept, possibly, the
nterplanetarian, although lack of power should have held Craven's
ship down to a lower speed. Craven wouldn't have dared to build up the
acceleration they had now attained, for he would have drained his banks
and been unable to charge them again.

Maybe he won't fight, said uss. Maybe he's figured out by this time
that he's heading for the wrong star. e may be glad to see us and
follow us back to the Solar System.

o chance of that. Craven and Chambers won't pass up a chance for a
fight. They'll give us a few wallops if only for the appearance of
things.

We're crawling up all the time, said uss. f we can catch him within
four or five billion miles of the star, he won't be too tough to handle.
e getting plenty of radiations even then, but not uite as much as he
would like to have.

e'll have to start decelerating pretty soon, Greg declared. e can't
run the chance of smashing into the planetary system at the speed he's
going. e won't want to waste too much power using his field as a brake,
because he must know by this time that we're after him and he'll want
what power he has to throw at us.

ours passed. The nvincible crept nearer and nearer, suddenly seemed
to leap ahead as the nterplanetarian began deceleration.

eep giving her all you got, Greg urged uss. We've got plenty of
power for braking. We can overhaul him and stop in a fraction of the
time he does.

uss nodded grimly. The distance indicator needle on the mechanical
shadow slipped off rapidly. Greg, leaping from his chair, hung over it,
breathlessly.

 think, he said, we better slow down now. f we don't, we'll be
inside the planetary system.

ow far out is Craven? asked uss.

ot far enough, Greg replied unhappily. e can't be more than three
billion miles from the star and that star's hot. A class G, all right,
but a good deal younger than old Sol.

                                   

We'll let them know we've arrived, grinned Greg. e sent a stabbing
beam of half a billion horsepower slashing at the nterplanetarian.

The other ship staggered but steadied itself.

They know, said uss cryptically from his position in front of the
vision plate. We shook them up a bit.

They waited. othing happened.

Greg scratched his head. Maybe you were right. Maybe they don't want to
fight.

Together they watched the nterplanetarian. t was still moving in
toward the distant sun, as if nothing had happened.

We'll see, said Greg.

ack at the controls he threw out a gigantic tractor beam, catching the
other ship in a net of forces that visibly cut its speed.

Space suddenly vomited lashing flame that slapped back and licked and
crawled in living streamers over the surface of the nvincible. The
engines moaned in their valiant battle to keep up the outer screen. The
pungent odor of oone filtered into the control room. The whole ship was
bucking and vibrating, creaking, as if it were being pulled apart.

So they don't want to fight, eh? hooted uss.

Greg gritted his teeth. They snapped the tractor beam.

They have power there, uss declared.

Too much, said Greg. More power than they have any right to have.

is hand went out to the lever on the board and pulled it back. A beam
smashed out, with the engines' screaming drive behind it, billions of
horsepower driving with unleashed ferocity at the other ship.

Greg's hand spun a dial, while the generators roared thunderous
defiance.

'm giving them the radiation scale, said Greg.

The nterplanetarian was staggering under the terrific bombardment,
but its screen was handling every ounce of the power that Greg was
pouring into it.

Their photocells can't handle that, cried uss. o photocell would
handle all that stuff you're shooting at them. nless ...

nless what?

nless Craven has improved on them.

We'll have to find out. Get the televisor.

                                   

uss leaped for the television machine.

A moment later he lifted a haggard face.

 can't get through, he said. Craven's got our beams stopped and now
he has our television blocked out.

Greg nodded. We might have epected that. When he could scramble our
televisors back in the ovian worlds, he certainly ought to be able to
screen his ship against them.

e shoved the lever clear over, slamming the etreme limit of power
into the beam. The engines screamed like demented things, howling and
shrieking. nstantly a tremendous sheet of solid flame spun a fiery web
around the nterplanetarian, turning it into a blaing inferno of
lapping, leaping fire.

A doen terrific beams, billions of horsepower in each, stabbed back at
the nvincible as the nterplanetarian shunted the terrific energy
influ from the overcharged accumulators to the various automatic energy
discharges.

The nvincible's screen flared in defense and the ten great engines
wailed in utter agony. More stabbing flame shot from the
nterplanetarian in slow eplosions.

The temperature in the nvincible's control room was rising. The oone
was sharp enough to make their eyes water and nostrils burn. The vision
glass was blanked out by the lapping flames that crawled and writhed
over the screen outside the glass.

uss tore his collar open, wiped his face with his shirt sleeve. Try a
pure magnetic

Greg, his face set and bleak as a wall of stone, grunted agreement. is
fingers danced over the control manual.

Suddenly the stars outside twisted and danced, like stars gone mad, as
if they were dancing a riotous ig in space, some uproariously hopping
up and down while others were applauding the show that was being
provided for their unblinking eyes.

The magnetic field was tightening now, twisting the light from those
distant stars and bending it straight again. The nterplanetarian
reeled like a drunken thing and the great arcs of electric flame looped
madly and plunged straight for the field's very heart.

                                   

The stars danced weirdly in faroff space again as the
nterplanetarian's accumulators lashed out with tremendous force to
oppose the energy of the field.

The field glowed softly and disappeared.

They have us stopped at every turn, groaned uss. There must be some
way, something we can do. e looked at Greg. Greg grinned without
humor, wiping his face. There is something we can do, said uss
grimly. We should have thought of it long ago.

e strode to the desk, reached out one hand and drew a calculator near.

ou keep them busy, he snapped. 'll have this thing figured out in
ust a while.

From the engine rooms came the roar and hum of the laboring units and
the nvincible shuddered once again as Greg grimly hurled one beam
after another, at the nterplanetarian.

The nterplanetarian struck back, using radio freuency that flamed
fiercely against the nvincible's outer screen. Simultaneously the
nterplanetarian leaped forward with a sudden surge of accumulated
energy, driving at the star that lay not more than three billion miles
away.

Greg worked desperately, cursing under his breath. e pulled down the
outer screen that was fighting directly against the radio freuency,
energy for energy, and allowed the beam to strike suarely on the second
screen, the inversion field that shunted the maor portion of the energy
impacting against it through  degrees into another space.

The engines moaned softly and settled into a uieter rumble as the
necessity of supplying the first screen was eliminated. ut they
screamed once again as Greg sent out a tractor beam that seied and
held, dragged the nterplanetarian to a standstill. Craven's ship had
gained millions of miles, though, and established a tremendous advantage
by fighting nearer to its source of energy.

uss, gasped Greg, if you don't get that scheme of yours figured out
pretty soon, we're done for. They've stopped everything we've got.
They're nearer the sun. We won't stand a chance if they make another
break like that.

uss glanced up to answer, but his mouth fell open in amaement and he
did not speak. A streak of terrible light was striking at them from the
nterplanetarian, blinding white light, and along that highway of
light swarmed a horde of little green figures, like suirming green
amebas. Swarming toward the nvincible, stretching out hungry,
palegreen pseudopods toward the inversion barrier ... and eating
through it

Wherever they touched, holes appeared. They drifted through the
inversion screen easily and began drilling into the inner screen of
antientropy. Eating their way into the antientropy ... into a state
of matter which uss and Greg had thought would resist all change

                                   

For seconds both men stood transfied, unable to believe the evidence of
their eyes. ut the ameba things came on in everincreasing throngs,
creatures that gnawed and slobbered at the antientropy, eating into it,
flaking it away, drilling their way through it.

When they pierced the antientropy, they would cut through the steel
plates of the nvincible like so much paper

And more were coming. More and more

With a grunt of amaement, Greg slammed a beam straight into the heart
of the amebas. They ate the beam and vanished as mistily as before,
little glowing things that ate and died. ut there were always more to
take their place. They overwhelmed the beam and ate back along its
length, attacked the screen again.

They ate through walls of force and walls of metal, and a rush of
hissing air began to flame into ions in the terrific battle of energies
outside the nvincible.

uss was crouching over the manual of the televisor board. is breath
moaned in his throat as his fingers flew.

 have to have power, Greg, he said. ots of power.

Take it. Greg replied.  haven't been able to do anything with it. t
isn't any use to me.

uss's thumb reached out and tripped the activating lever. The giant
engines shrieked and yowled.

Something was happening on the television screen ... something
terrifying. Craven's ship seemed to retreat suddenly for millions of
miles ... and as suddenly the nvincible appeared on the screen. For a
single flashing instant, the view held then it was gone in blank
grayness. For seconds nothing happened on the screen, unnerving seconds
while the two men held their breath.

The screen's grayness fled and they looked into the control room of the
nterplanetarian. Craven was hunched in a chair, intent upon a series
of controls. ehind him and to one side stood Stutsman, a heat pistol
dangled from his hand, his face twisted into a sneer of triumph. There
was no sign of Chambers.

ou damn fool, Craven was snapping at Stutsman. ou're cheating us
out of the only chance we ever had of getting home.

                                   

Shut up, snarled Stutsman, the pistol erking in his hand. ave you
got that apparatus on full power?

t's been on full power for minutes now, said Craven. t must be
eating holes straight through Manning's ship.

See you keep it that way.  really don't need you any more, anyhow.
've watched and  know all the tricks.  could carry on this battle
singlehanded.

Craven did not reply, merely hunched closer over the controls, eyes
watching flickering dials.

Greg ogged uss's elbow. That must be the apparatus over there, in the
corner of the room. That triangular affair. A condenser of some sort.
That stuff they're throwing at us must be supersaturated force fields
and they'd need a spacefield condenser for that.

uss nodded. We'll take care of that.

is fingers moved swiftly and a transport beam whipped out, riding the
television beam. ands of force wrapped around the triangular machine
and wrenched viciously. n the screen the apparatus disappeared ...
simply was gone. t now lay within the nvincible's control room,
erked there by the teletransport.

The flood of daling light reaching out from the nterplanetarian
snapped off and the little green ameba things were gone. The shrill
whistle of escaping air stopped as the eaten screens clamped down again,
sealing in the atmosphere despite the holes bored through the metal
plates.

n the television screen, Craven leaped from his chair, was staring with
Stutsman at the place where the concentrator had stood. The machine had
been ripped from a welded base and agged, bright, torn metal gleamed in
the control room lights. Snapped cables and broken busbars lay piled
about the room.

What happened? Stutsman was screaming. They heard Craven laugh at the
terror in the other's voice. Manning ust walked in and grabbed it away
from us.

ut he couldn't We had the screen up e couldn't get through

Craven shrugged his shoulders.  don't know how he did it, but he did.
robably he could clean out the whole place if he wanted to.

That's a good idea, said uss, udiciously.

e stripped bank after bank of the other ship's photocells from their
moorings, wrecked the force field controls, ripped cables from the
engines and left the ship without means of collecting power, without
means of using power, without means of movement, of offense or defense.

                                   

e leaned back in his chair and regarded the screen with deep
satisfaction.

That, he decided, should hold them for a while.

e hauled the pipe out of his pocket and filled it from the battered
leather pouch.

Greg regarded him with a uiical stare. ou sent the televisor back
in time. ou got it inside the nterplanetarian before Craven had run
up his screen and then you brought it forward.

ou guessed it, said uss, tamping the tobacco into the bowl. We
should have thought of that long ago. We have a time factor there. n
fact, the whole thing revolves around time. We move the televisor, we
use the teletransport, by giving the obects we wish to move an
acceleration in time.

Greg wrinkled his brow. Maybe that means we can really investigate the
past, or even the future. Can sit here before our screen and see
everything that has happened, everything that is going to happen.

uss shook his head.  don't know, Greg. otice, though, that we got no
screen response until the televisor came up out of the past and actually
reached the point which coincided with the present. That is, the screen
and the televisor itself have to be on the same time level for them to
operate. We might modify the screen, even modify the televisor so that
we could travel in time, but it will take a lot of research, a lot of
work. And especially it will take a whale of a lot of power.

We have the power, said Greg.

uss moved the lighter back and forth over the tobacco, igniting it
carefully. Clouds of blue smoke swirled around his head. e spoke out of
the smoke.

ight now, he said, we better see how Craven and our other friends
are getting along.  didn't like the way Stutsman was talking or the way
he was swinging that gun around. And Chambers wasn't anywhere in sight.
There's something screwy about the entire thing.

                                   

What are we going to do now? demanded Stutsman.

Craven grinned at him. That's up to you. emember, you're the master
mind around here. ou took over and said you were going to run things.
e waved a casual hand at the shattered machines, the rippedout
apparatus. Well, there you are. Go ahead and run the oint.

ut you will have to help, pleaded Stutsman, his face twisted until it
seemed that he was suffering intense physical agony. ou know what to
do.  don't.

Craven shook his head. There isn't any use starting. Manning will be
along almost anytime now. We'll wait and see what he has in mind.

Manning shrieked Stutsman, waving the pistol wildly. Always Manning.
ne would think you were working for Manning.

e's the big shot out in this little corner of space right now, Craven
pointed out. There isn't any way you can get around that.

Stutsman backed carefully away. is gun came up and he looked at Craven
appraisingly, as if selecting his targets.

ut down that gun, said a voice.

Gregory Manning stood between Stutsman and Craven. There had been no
foggy forerunner of his appearance. e had ust snapped out of empty
air.

Stutsman stared at him, his eyes widening, but the gun remained steady
in his hand.

ook out, Craven, warned Greg. e's going to fire and it will go
right through me and hit you.

                                   

There was the thump of a falling body as Craven hurled himself out of
his chair, hit the floor and rolled. Stutsman's gun vomited flame. The
spouting flame passed through Greg's image, blasted against the chair in
which Craven had sat, fused it until it fell in on itself.

uss, said Greg uietly, disarm this fellow before he hurts
somebody.

An unseen force reached out and twisted the gun from Stutsman's hand,
flung it to one side. Swiftly Stutsman's hands were forced behind his
back and held there by invisible bonds.

Stutsman cried out, tried to struggle, but he was unable to move. t was
as if giant hands had gripped him, were holding him in a viselike
clutch.

Thanks, Manning, said Craven, getting up off the floor. The fool
would have shot this time. e's threatened it for days. e has been
developing a homicidal mania.

We don't need to worry about him now, declared Greg. e turned around
to face Craven. Where's Chambers?

Stutsman locked him up, said Craven.  imagine he has the key in his
pocket. ocked him up in the stateroom. Chambers umped him and tried to
take the gun away from him and Stutsman laid him out, hit him over the
head. e kept Chambers locked up after that. asn't allowed anyone to go
near the room. asn't even given him food and water. That was three days
ago.

Get the key out of his pocket, directed Greg. Go and see how Chambers
is.

Alone in the control room with Stutsman, Greg looked at him.

 have a score to settle with you, Stutsman, he said.  had intended
to let it ride, but not now.

ou can't touch me, blustered Stutsman. ou wouldn't dare.

What makes you think  wouldn't?

ou're bluffing. ou've got a lot of tricks, but you can't do the
things you would like me to think you can. ou've got Chambers and
Craven fooled, but not me.

t may be that  can offer you definite proof.

Chambers staggered over the threshold. is clothing was rumpled. A rude
bandage was wound around his head. is face was haggard and his eyes
red.

ello, Manning, he said.  suppose you've won. The Solar System must
be in your control by now.

e lifted his hand to his mustache, brushed it, a feeble attempt at
playing the old role he'd acted so long.

We've won, said Greg uietly, but you're wrong about our being in
control. The governments are in the hands of the people, where they
should be.

Chambers nodded.  see, he mumbled. ifferent people, different
ideas. is eyes rested on Stutsman and Greg saw sudden rage sweep
across the gray, haggard face. So you've got him, have you? What are
you going to do with him? What are you going to do with all of us?

 haven't had time to think about it, said Greg. 've principally
been thinking about Stutsman here.

e mutinied, rasped Chambers. e seied the ship, turned the crew
against me.

And the penalty for that, said Greg, uietly, is death. eath by
walking in space.

Stutsman writhed within the bands of force that held him tight. is face
contorted. o, damn you ou can't do that ot to me, you can't

Shut up, roared Chambers and Stutsman uieted.

 was thinking, too, said Greg, that at his order thousands of people
were mercilessly shot down back in the Solar System. Stood against a
wall and mowed down. thers were killed like wild animals in the street.
Thousands of them.

                                   

e moved slowly toward Stutsman and the man cringed.

Stutsman, he said, you're a butcher. ou're a stench in the nostrils
of humanity. ou aren't fit to live.

Those, said Craven, are my sentiments eactly.

ou hate me, screamed Stutsman. All of you hate me. ou are doing
this because you hate me.

Everyone hates you, Stutsman, said Greg. Every living person hates
you. ou have a cloud of hate hanging over you as black and wide as
space.

The man closed his eyes, trying to break free of the bonds.

ring me a spacesuit, snapped Greg, watching Stutsman's face.

Craven brought it and dropped it at Stutsman's feet.

All right, uss, said Greg. Turn him loose.

Stutsman swayed and almost fell as the bands of force released him.

Get into that suit, ordered Greg.

Stutsman hesitated, but something he saw in Greg's face made him lift
the suit, step into it, fasten it about his body.

What are you going to do with me? he whimpered. ou aren't going to
take me back to Earth again, are you? ou aren't going to make me stand
trial?

o, said Greg, gravely, we aren't taking you back to Earth. And
you're standing trial right now.

Stutsman read his fate in the cold eyes that stared into his. Chattering
frightenedly, he rushed at Greg, plunged through him, collided with the
wall of the ship and toppled over, feebly attempting to rise.

nvisible hands hoisted him to his feet, gripped him, held him upright.
Greg walked toward him, stood facing him.

Stutsman, he said, you have four hours of air. That will give you
four hours to think, to make your peace with death. e turned toward
the other two. Chambers nodded grimly. Craven said nothing.

And now, said Greg to Craven, if you will fasten down his helmet.

The helmet clanged shut, shutting out the pleas and threats that came
from Stutsman's throat.

                                   

Stutsman saw distant stars, cruel, gleaming eyes that glared at him.
Empty space fell away on all sides.

umbed by fear, he realied where he was. Manning had picked him up and
thrown him far into space ... out into that waste where for hundreds of
light years there was only the awful nothingness of space.

e was less than a speck of dust, in this great immensity of emptiness.
There was no up or down, no means of orientation.

oneliness and terror closed in on him, a terrible agony of fear. n
four hours his air would be gone and then he would die is body would
swirl and eddy through this great cosmic ocean. t would never be found.
t would remain here, embalmed by the cold of space, until the last clap
of eternity.

There was one way, the easy way. is hand reached up and grasped the
connection between his helmet and the air tank. ne wrench and he would
die swiftly, uickly ... instead of letting death stalk him through the
darkness for the net four hours.

e shivered and his hand loosened its hold, dropped away. e was afraid
to hasten death. e wanted to put it off. e was afraid of death ...
horribly afraid.

The stars mocked him and he seemed to hear hooting laughter from
somewhere far away. Curiously, it sounded like his own laughter....

                                   

'll make it easy for you, Manning, Chambers said.  know that all of
us are guilty. Guilty in the eyes of the people and the law. Guilty in
your eyes. f we had won, there would have been no penalty. There's
never a penalty for the one who wins.

enalty, said Greg, his eyes half smiling. Why, yes,  think there
is. 'm going to order you aboard the nvincible for something to eat
and to get some rest.

ou mean to say that we aren't prisoners?

Greg shook his head. ot prisoners, he said. Why,  came out here to
guide you back to Earth.  hauled you out here and got you into this
am. t was up to me to get you out of it.  would have done the same
for Stutsman, too, but ...

e hesitated and looked at Chambers.

Chambers stared back and slowly nodded.

es, Manning, he said.  think  understand.




CATE TWETE


Chambers lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair.

 wish you could see it my way, Manning, he said. There's no place
for me on Earth, no place for me in the Solar System. ou see,  tried
and failed. 'm ust a hasbeen back there.

e laughed uietly. Somehow,  can't imagine myself coming back in the
role of the defeated tribal leader, chained to your chariot, so to
speak.

ut it wouldn't be that way, protested Greg. our company is gone,
true, and your stocks are worthless, but you haven't lost everything.
ou still have a fleet of ships. With our new power, the Solar System
will especially need ships. ots of ships. For the spacelanes will be
filled with commerce. ou'd be coming back to a new deal, a new Solar
System, a place that has been transformed almost overnight by power
that's practically free.

es, yes,  know all that, said Chambers. ut  climbed too high. 
got too big.  can't come back now as something small, a failure.

ou have things we need, said Greg. The screen that blankets out our
television and teletransport, for eample. We need your screen as a
safeguard against the very thing we have created. Think of what criminal
uses could be made of the teletransport. o vault, no net of charged
wires, nothing, could stop a thief from taking anything he wanted.
risons would cease to be prisons. Criminals could reach in and pick up
their friends, no matter how many guards there were. risons and bank
vaults and national treasuries could be cleaned out in a single day.

Then there's the supersaturated space fields, added uss, ruefully.
Those almost got us. f  hadn't thought of moving the televisor
through time, we would have had to pull stakes and run for it.

o, you wouldn't, pointed out Craven. ou could have wiped us out in
a moment. ou can disintegrate matter. Send it up in a puff of smoke ...
rip every electron apart and send it hurtling away.

f course we could have, Craven, said Greg, but we wouldn't.

Chambers laughed softly. ot uite mad enough at us to do that, eh?

Greg looked at him.  guess that must have been it.

ut 'm curious about the green space fields, persisted uss.

Simple, said Craven. They were ust fields that had more energy
packed into a certain portion of space than space could take. Space
fields that had far more than their share of energy, more than they
could hold. A supersaturated solution will crystalie almost
immediately onto the tiniest crystal put into it. Those fields acted the
same way. They crystalied instantly into hyperspace the moment they
came into contact with other energy, whether as photons of radiation,
matter or other space fields. our antientropy didn't stand a chance
under those conditions. When they crystalied, they took a chunk of the
field along with them, a small chunk, but one after another they ate a
hole right through your screen.

                                   

Something like that would have a commercial value, said Greg. seful
in war, too, and now that mankind has taken to space, now that we're
spreading out, we must think of possible attack. There must be life on
other planets throughout the Galay. Someday they'll come. f they
don't, someday we'll go to them. And we may need every type of armament
we can get our hands on.

Chambers knocked the ash off his cigar and was staring out the vision
port. The ship had swung so that through the port could be seen the
distant star toward which the nterplanetarian had been driving.

For my part, said Chambers, slowly, measuring each word, you can have
those findings of ours. We'll give them to you, knowing you will use
them as they should be used. Craven can tell you how they work. That is,
if Craven wants to. e is the man who developed them.

Certainly, said Craven. They'll be something to remember us by.

                                   

ut you are coming back with us, aren't you? asked Greg.

Craven shook his head. o, 'm going with Chambers.  don't know what
he's thinking of, but whatever it is, it's all right with me. We've been
together too long. 'd miss someone to fight with.

Chambers was still staring out the vision port. e was talking, but he
did not seem to be talking to them.

 had a dream, you see.  saw the people struggling against the
inefficiency and stupidity of popular government.  saw the periodic
rise of bad leaders.  saw them lead the people into blunders.  read
history and  saw that since the time man had risen from the ape, this
had been going on. So  proposed to give the people scientific
government ... a business administration. An administration that would
have run the government eactly as a successful businessman runs his
business. The people would have resented it if  had told them they
didn't know how to run their affairs. There was only one way to do
it ... gain control and force it down their throats.

Chambers was no longer a beaten man, no longer a man with a white
bandage around his head and his power stripped from him. nce again he
was the fighting financier who had sat back at the desk in the
nterplanetary building on Earth and issued orders ... orders that sped
across millions of miles of space.

e shrugged his shoulders. They didn't want it. Man doesn't want to
live under scientific government. e doesn't want to be protected
against blunders. e wants what he calls freedom. The right to do the
things he wants to do, even if it means making a damn fool of himself.
The right to rise to great heights and tumble to eually low depths.
That's human nature and  ruled it out. ut you can't rule out human
nature.

They sat in silence, no one speaking. uss cupped his pipe bowl in his
hand and watched Chambers. Chambers leaned back and slowly puffed at
the cigar. Greg ust sat, his face unchanging.

Craven finally broke the silence. ust what are you planning to do?

Chambers flicked his hand toward the distant sun that gleamed through
the vision port.

There's a new solar system out there, he said. ew worlds, a new sun.
A place to start over again. ou and  discovered it. t's ours by right
of discovery. We'll go there and stake out our claim.

ut there may be nothing there, protested Greg. That sun is younger
than our Sun. The planets may not have cooled as yet. ife may not have
developed.

n such a case, said Chambers, we shall find another planetary system
around another sun. A system that has cooled, where there is life.

uss gasped. ere was something important, something that should set a
precedent. The first men to roam from star to star seeking new worlds.
The first men to turn their backs on the old solar system and strike out
in search of new worlds swinging in their paths around distant suns.

Greg was saying, All right, if that's the way you want it.  was hoping
you'd come back with us. ut we'll help you repair your ship. We'll give
you all the supplies we can spare.

uss rose to his feet. That, he said, calls for a little drink.

e opened a cabinet and took out bottles and glasses.

nly three, said Chambers. Craven doesn't drink.

Craven interrupted. our one for me, too, age.

Chambers looked at the scientist, astounded.  never knew you to take a
drink in your life.

Craven twisted his face into a grin. This is a special occasion.

                                   

The nvincible was nearing Mars, heading for Earth, which was still a
greenish sphere far to one side of the flaming Sun.

uss watched the little green globe, thinking.

Earth was home. To him it always would be home. ut that would be
changed soon. ust a few more generations, and, to millions upon
millions of human beings, Earth no longer would be home.

With the new material energy engines, life on every planet would be
possible now, even easy. The cost of manufacture, mining, shipping
across the vast distances between the planets would be only a fraction
of what it had been when man had been forced to rely upon the unwieldy,
epensive accumulator system of supplying lifegiving power.

ow Mars would have power of her own. Even luto could generate her own.
And power was ... well, it was power. The power to live, the power to
work, to establish and maintain commerce, to adust gravity to Earth
standard or to any standard. The power to remake and reshape and rebuild
planetary conditions to suit man eactly.

Earthmen and Earthwomen would be moving out en masse now to the new and
virgin fields of endeavorto the farms of enus, to the manufacturing
centers that were springing up on Mars, to the mines of the ovian
worlds, to the great laboratory plants that would spring up on Titan and
on luto and on the other colder worlds.

The migration of races had started long ago. n the ld Stone Age, the
CroMagnon had swept out of nowhere to oust the eanderthal. Centuries
later the barbarians of the north, in another of those restless
migrations, had overwhelmed and swept away the oman Empire. And many
centuries later, migration had turned from Europe to a new world across
the sea, and fighting Americans had battled their way from east to west,
conuering a continent.

And now another great migration was onman was leaving the Earth,
moving into space. e was leaving behind him the world that had reared
and fostered him. e was striking out and out. First the planets would
be overrun, and then man would leap from the planets to the stars

                                   

For years after America had become a country, had built a tradition of
her own, Europe was regarded by millions as the homeland. ut as the
years swept by, this had ceased to be and the Americas were a world unto
themselves, owing nothing to Europe.

And that was the way it would be with Earth. For centuries, for
thousands of years, Earth would be the Mother lanet, the homeland for
all the millions of roaming men and women who dared the gulfs of space
and the strangeness of new worlds. There would be trips back to the
Earth for sentimental reasons ... to see the place where one's ancestors
were born and had lived, to goggle at the monument which marked the
point from which the first spaceship had taken off for the Moon, to
visit old museums and see old cities and breathe the air that men and
women had breathed for thousands of years before they found the power to
take them anywhere.

n the end, Earth would be ust a wornout planet. Even now her
minerals were rapidly being ehausted her oil wells were dry and all
her coal was mined her industry stabilied and filled her businesses
interlocking and highly competitive. A world that was too full, that had
too many things, too many activities, too many people. A world that
didn't need men and women. A world where even genius was kept from
rising to the top.

And this was what was driving mankind away from the Earth. The
competition, the crowded conditions, in business and industrial fields,
the lack of opportunity for new development, the everlasting struggle to
get ahead, fighting for a place to live when millions of others were
fighting for the same thing. ut not entirely that, not that alone.
There was something elsethat old adventuresome spirit, the driving
urge to face new dangers, to step over old frontiers, to do and dare, to
make a damn fool of one's self, or to surpass the greatest
accomplishments of history.

ut Earth would never die, for there was a part of Earth in every man
and woman who would go forth into space, part of Earth's courage, part
of Earth's ideals, part of Earth's dreams. The habits and the virtues
and the faults that Earth had spawned and fostered ... these were things
that would never die. ld Earth would live forever. Even when she was
drifting dust and the Sun was a dead, cold star, Earth would live on in
the courage and the dreams that by that time would be spreading to the
far corners of the Galay.

uss dug the pipe out of his pocket, searched for the pouch, found it on
the desk behind him. t was empty.

ell, he said, my tobacco's all gone.

Greg grinned. ou won't have to wait long. We'll be back on Earth in a
few more hours.

uss put the stem between his teeth, bit down on it savagely.  guess
that's right.  can dry smoke her until we get there.

Earth was larger now. Mars had swung astern.

Suddenly a winking light stabbed out into space from the night side of
Earth. Signaling ... signaling ... clearing the spacelanes for a greater
future than any human prophet had ever predicted.

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of euipment including outdated euipment.  Many small donations
 to , are particularly important to maintaining ta eempt
status with the S.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all  states of the nited
States.  Compliance reuirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these reuirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SE ATS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http:pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation reuirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

nternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning ta treatment of donations received from
outside the nited States.  .S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses.  onations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http:pglaf.orgdonate


Section .  General nformation About roect Gutenbergtm electronic
works.

rofessor Michael S. art is the originator of the roect Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed roect
Gutenbergtm eooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


roect Gutenbergtm eooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as ublic omain in the .S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
